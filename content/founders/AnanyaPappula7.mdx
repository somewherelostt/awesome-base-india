## About

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer, open-source enthusiast, and digital artist who loves creating innovative solutions with technology. My journey in tech spans across web development, mobile app development, and leveraging AI for meaningful impact.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Farm Flow, a platform providing data-driven insights for farmers to optimize their practices. I'm also leading the development of ChatSphere, an open-source project enabling users to interact with their favorite LLMs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development, AI, or sustainability. If you're building something exciting, let’s connect!
