## About

My name is **Sayan Genri**, and I am currently pursuing a B-Tech degree in the Computer Science Department. I have a strong passion for blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and specifically, Ethereum. On the other side of my academic pursuits, I am actively engaged as a backend developer, utilizing Django technology to create robust and efficient solutions.

I find the intersection of blockchain and backend development particularly fascinating, and I am enthusiastic about exploring how these fields can complement each other. The dynamic nature of blockchain, coupled with the innovation in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, motivates me to delve deeper into these realms.

I am eager to continue my academic and professional journey, combining my interest in blockchain technology with my skills in backend development to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.

Best regards,
Sayan Genri
