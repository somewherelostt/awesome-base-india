## About

I am a **computer science **student with a passion for exploring the cutting-edge technologies of the future. My current focus is on learning about **web3** and **blockchain development**, and how these technologies can be used to create decentralised, secure, and transparent systems. I have a background in programming and software development, and I am always eager to learn more about new languages and tools that can help me build innovative solutions. In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest developments in web3 and blockchain, and participating in **hackathons** and coding competitions to test my skills and push my boundaries."
