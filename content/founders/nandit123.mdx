## About

I love working on projects that have an impact on the masses. Working on new technlogies is my thing - ReactJS, NodeJS, Machine Learning, Blockchain, Machine Learning, Django are those that top my current list of tech interests and have made some projects on them. 
Making an impact drives me to do stuff and also help others, i try to solve problems of others to my best if they reach out to me. 
Most complex project that i have worked on is -> making telemetry algorithm for a team making fuel effiicient car to participate in Shell Eco-Marathon Asia edition. I learned from it that, we need to divide the problem into as small chunks as possible and the complete each of them to progress to solving the bigger one. In this project only, i had experience with communicating people from other streams (Mechanical Engineering) and understanding their requirements and then building the product accordingly. It has been a great learning experience overall for me.
I am also selected to take part in HackMIT in MIT, USA in september.
Yes as i said, i am the winner for HackMIT 2018 at MIT in USA. :)
