## About

I have been working with blockchain technology since past 1 year. I was immediately fascinated by the potential of this new technology and began learning everything I could about it. My fascination led me to develop a number of applications using blockchain technology, including a Bank KYC smart contract,a Domain buying website, a USDT onchain tracker etc.
