## About

I'm a Blockchain developer with expertise in Solidity and Rust, specializing in smart contract development for both EVM and non-EVM blockchains. Experienced in Web3.js, Ethers.js, and frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat, and Substrate, I build secure and efficient decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. I also have hands-on experience with token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721, with a strong focus on blockchain security best practices.
