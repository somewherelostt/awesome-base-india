## About

"Hi, I’m Lokesh from Chennai, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Loyola-ICAM College of Engineering and Technology. I have experience working on software-oriented projects, including a successful participation in the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), where my team developed a website to verify the authenticity of documents for the PMSSS scholarship, eliminating the need for physical submissions. Additionally, I was part of a project called Technoteen, an app for cash flow management, which secured third prize in a competition held at my college. I’m passionate about learning new technical thinking styles, and I actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills through hands-on projects and events."
