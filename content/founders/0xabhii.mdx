## About

**Abhishek Yadav**

**Builder | DevRel & BD | Storyteller of Crypto Things**

Been around the block(chain) doing a mix of **DevRel, BD, and content** — helping projects grow communities, close partnerships, and tell their story in a way that actually lands.

At **Qoneqt**, I debugged wallets + cross-chain issues, refined onboarding flows, and scaled 30+ workshops across 10+ cities (2,000+ devs onboarded). Closed partnerships with **Huddle01, Sandbox, Quillaudits, Okto, Router Protocol**, and more. Before that, with **The Graph**, I co-authored docs, taught 1,000+ builders about subgraphs + smart contracts, and supported events like **EtherNite** with Chainlink + Arbitrum.

Also co-founded **Attenomics**, a verifiable attention layer for social engagement — scaled from 0 → 500+ users and landed a paying customer. On the side, I keep hacking: **LendChips (Unfold winner), Encryptix (ETHGlobal Bangkok winner), OwnSound (Hacker House Goa winner)**.

Obsessed with **ZK, DeFi, and privacy infra**. I write, I teach, I BD, I build — basically a **jack of all trades, but always shipping**.
