## About

I am really interested in solving complicated problems in a variety of technology stacks. I am proficient in C, C++, Python and have worked on Haskell, Clojure, Lisp and more. I work mostly on implementing algorithms and playing around with them optimizing them or fine-tuning them in C++. I also love working with hardware mostly in C to solve day to day problems. I also use C for creating parallel codes to run something that's time critical. I mostly use python for my scripting, data scraping, testing, automation tasks.

Recently I have also come to explore the blockchain space upto a certain degree, all due to the fantastic experience from ETHIndia 2.0(Top 6 Teams) and Game Oasis Bangalore(Cocos Bcx bounty winner)

I am really amazed as to how technology has transformed the world. How a really complicated distributed system finally boils down to something that can be represented in something simple as a Turing machine.How few technologies like UNIX,C ,Linux, GNU changed the world for the better. I see that technology has a lot of potential in transforming our lives. Also I am quite an Open Source nerd too :)

It gives the power to impact so many people. So many that it is even beyond our imagination. I have always wanted to work for the betterment of society. make an impact on society. And Technology I feel is the best tool for that.

I am a huge fan of computer science research and I feel that is yet another thing that drives. I love delving deep into the papers that fundamentally changed our lives today. They give me a lot of insight as to how something evolved, why, where and when. 

One of the complicated projects that I embarked on was a HUGE Persistence of vision display(with support to display any kind of content). It was a real cross domain project which involved going deep into the SPI interfacing, bitbanging in communication through GPIO pins so as to get the maximum real-time perception. In fact, each LED has to be addressed in a matter of several micros
