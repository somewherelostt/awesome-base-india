## About

I’m **Mousum Gogoi**, a B.Tech student in Mechanical Engineering at Jorhat Engineering College, graduating in 2026. My interests lie in IoT, machine learning, AI, and industrial automation, with skills in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript.

I’m the Founder and CTO of [AgroNexa Solutions](http://agronexasolutions.in/), where I lead the design of scalable, IoT and AI-driven agricultural solutions. I’ve also had the privilege of working as an R&D Associate at Bishnu Engineering Pvt Ltd, where I developed IoT-based industrial automation using Raspberry Pi, and as a remote ML Engineer at AIPEC, focusing on mirror trading and stock monitoring applications.

I have spearheaded several innovative projects, including an ongoing autonomous drone development with a custom flight controller and MediNet, an app for healthcare management.

Some of my key achievements include winning the [CSIR-NEIST BioNEST Idea Hunt](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agronexa-solutions_agronexasolutions-innovation-sustainability-activity-7248028002846945281-a1as?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), [MeiTY TIDE 2.0 North-East Techathon X4](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agronexa-solutions_agronexa-techathonx4-tide2-activity-7243653649703313408-mOnm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), and the Rishikesh Borpuzari Memorial Ideathon 2023. I also secured runner-up positions in the Escoventure B-plan Competition and Codenovus Competitive Coding Competition.

I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges, constantly exploring new ways to innovate in AI, IoT, and automation​.
