## About

As a computer application graduate, my journey into the world of blockchain technology has been both unexpected and incredibly rewarding. After graduating, I attempted to pursue postgraduate studies but couldn't complete them. This led me to explore other avenues, and during a diploma course, I discovered the Certified Blockchain Architect course at Kerala Digital University.
