## About

I’m a tech enthusiast driven by curiosity and a passion for building products from scratch. With over 2 years of experience as a full-stack developer, I thrive on exploring and experiencing technology hands-on. 
Currently, I’m a Founding Engineer at Niti.ai, where I focus on developing innovative no coding solutions using embeddable systems. 
My interests also extend to open-source development and contributing to dynamic, fast-moving startups.
I’ve been fortunate to win Ethereum hackathons and actively engage in Web3 development. Connect with me if our interests align!
