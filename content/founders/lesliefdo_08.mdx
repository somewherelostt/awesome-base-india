## About

As a Computer Engineering student with hands-on experience in web development and cybersecurity, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology. My journey—from crafting melodies as a musician to coding dynamic websites and exploring the frontiers of AI—has taught me to approach challenges with both innovation and analytical rigor. Currently, I am sharpening my skills as a Web Development and Cybersecurity Intern, where I’ve contributed to real-world projects that enhance user experience and strengthen online security. My proficiency spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Power BI, and data analytics, enabling me to turn data into actionable insights. Driven by curiosity, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and make a positive impact. Whether collaborating on cross-functional teams or diving deep into new domains, I embrace each opportunity to learn and grow.
