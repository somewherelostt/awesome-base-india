## About

I'm a second year CompSci undergrad from amity university, noida. 

I'm building an end to end software product which aims to solve the content management problems faced by ecosystems in web 3, information distribution and low engagement.

This effort consists of an event calendar which provides access to the transcripts, summaries, archive and Translations for the concluded and Notifications for the upcoming spaces using the CMS, Summaries for twitter spaces, youtube videos and podcasts , a scalable RaG pipeline (powered by our in house data aggregators) which tie into any platform of your choice and a search engine which lets us search through the data within an ecosystem (powered by our unified content index)

All of this effort is to provide the end user with a much more comprehensive user experience and prioritises learning instead of overwhelming the user with content

I participated in the SUI blockchain builder program and my project got accepted and I received a substantial grant from that. I'm currently participating in the Polygon Consumer crypto grant program.
