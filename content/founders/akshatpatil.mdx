## About

I am a Second year engineering student who is really interested in the world of blockchains and how they can change the existing infrastructure. I was always interested in subjects like psycology, economics, cs and math which naturally led me into the world of blockchains. I am particularly interested in the financial side of things when it comes to blockchains.
