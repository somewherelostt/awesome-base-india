## About

Hi, I’m Om Bhojane
I’m an AI engineer in the making who loves building projects that combine AI and blockchain to solve real problems. Most of my learning comes from hackathons, where I enjoy turning ideas into working products in just a day or two.

I’ve worked with LLMs, RAG pipelines, vector databases, explainable AI, and fine-tuning models. Lately, I’ve also been exploring DeFi, smart contracts, and prediction markets, bringing together AI and Web3.

What I enjoy

- Building AI-first applications that feel natural and useful

- Exploring how blockchain and decentralized systems can create trust and new opportunities

- Working in hackathons where learning, collaboration, and creativity come fast

- Taking an idea from scratch → prototype → product

Skills

- AI/ML: RAG, VectorDBs, Transformers, XAI, GANs, RLHF

- Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, LangChain, HuggingFace

- Full Stack: MERN, Next.js, Flask, FastAPI, Django

- Blockchain/Web3: Solidity, smart contracts, DeFi, prediction markets
