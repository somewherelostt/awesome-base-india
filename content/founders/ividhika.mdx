## About

Hey there! I'm **Vidhika**, a 20-year-old curious explorer navigating the tech world while sipping chai and cracking bugs like they're peanuts. 🌱

Currently:
- 🎓 Pursuing my degree in [Your Major/Branch Here]
- 🚀 On a mission to turn ideas into impactful digital products
- 📚 Preparing for GATE with caffeine-fueled nights and consistent hustle

## 💡 What I love
- 💻 Building small but smart projects (the MVP energy is real!)
- ⚡ Participating in hackathons where I can learn, build, *maybe even win*
- 🧠 Exploring AI, frontend design, and anything that screams *"cool tech"*
- ✍️ Documenting my journey (because every bug has a story 🐛)

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- `HTML` | `CSS` | `JavaScript`
- `React` | `Node.js`
- `Git` | `GitHub` | `VS Code`
- Currently learning: `TypeScript`, `DSA`, and a sprinkle of `Python`

## 🏆 Hackathon Philosophy
> "Win? Great. Learn? Even better. Free swag? Say less." 😎

## 🐾 Fun Facts
- I believe good UI is a love language ✨
- I once debugged something for 3 hours just to find a missing semicolon 😭
- I keep a fitness log and believe tech + health = superpower 💪
