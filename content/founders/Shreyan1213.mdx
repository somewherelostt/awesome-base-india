## About

I am a front-end and Web3 developer with two years of experience, specializing in technologies such as Node.js, React, Next.js, Python, Solidity, and Move. My journey in the crypto and blockchain space has been marked by active contributions to DeFi projects and involvement in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) like BanyanDAO and PubDAO. Here, I've collaborated on various initiatives, sharing insights and solutions with a community of like-minded developers.

In addition to my development work, I have participated in several hackathons, achieving notable recognition as a finalist in the Gaianet LKS and Huddle01 Hack events, and securing a prize in the Encode Video Hack. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of blockchain technologies, enabling me to deliver innovative solutions under tight deadlines.

Currently, I am particularly interested in building Web3 applications that leverage artificial intelligence. I am excited about the potential of integrating AI with blockchain to create more accessible and user-friendly decentralized applications.
