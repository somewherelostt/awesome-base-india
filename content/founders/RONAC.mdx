## About

For ETH India, here's a suggestion for what you can write in the "README.md" section:

About Me:

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast with experience in building innovative solutions using blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Over the past year, I have worked extensively in the Web3 space, particularly as a tech consultant for Aloha Protocol, an incubated and funded startup. There, I was part of the core team, contributing to product development, managing smart contracts, and optimizing the platform’s scalability.

What Drives Me:

What excites me about technology is the limitless potential for innovation and the ability to solve real-world problems. I believe decentralization is the future, and I’m committed to building systems that offer transparency, security, and user empowerment. Whether it's tackling problems in loyalty programs or finding new ways to leverage blockchain, my goal is to make tech more accessible and meaningful for everyone.

Projects I've Built:

LesGo: A customer retention and loyalty platform for restaurants, with a focus on building meaningful connections through loyalty rewards, using data-driven insights to optimize customer engagement.
