## About

I’m Dipesh Sukhani, currently CEO at BuildBear Labs (leading deterministic sandboxes and CI/CD tooling for Web3 and AVS/EigenLayer applications). My journey has always been about shipping real products, solving pain points for developers, and making “impossible” ideas production-grade.

What I’m Good At:

Taking Web3 from idea → production: Led teams launching dApps, infra, and full-stack solutions from hackathons to mainnet.

Relentless builder energy: I thrive in focused, high-velocity environments. At BuildBear, I implemented rapid iteration loops, cutting dev-test-deploy cycles from days to hours.

Community and team glue: I love mentoring, code reviews, and elevating the squad—I run regular internal “product hack” jams and dev workshops.

Full-stack battle-tested: Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat, Node.js, TypeScript, wagmi, Ethers, and all the fun infra (on both EVM and L2s).

What Drives Me:

Builder’s itch: If something can be done better, faster or more elegantly, I need to build it and share with the community.

Teaching & enabling: Making it easier for the next wave of devs to build, experiment, and ship.

Pushing boundaries: Always chasing the “what’s next”—whether that’s cross-chain tooling, ZK-powered apps, or next-gen developer experience.

Notable Projects:

BuildBear Labs: Bootstrapped and scaled as CEO—now a key developer tool in the Web3 ecosystem.

AVS/EigenLayer Sandbox: Built the first deterministic dev sandbox for AVS protocols, inspired by the need for safer innovation and permissionless experimentation.

Protocol Integrations: Led partnerships and integrations with major L1/L2s, improving onboarding for devs globally.
