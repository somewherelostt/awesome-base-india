### 🚀 Frontend Developer | 3D Web Enthusiast | AI Experimenter  

I’m a student developer from India who builds web experiences that look alive smooth 3D interfaces, responsive UIs, and interactions that feel intuitive.  
Currently, I’m focusing on **combining advanced frontend with AI** to make apps that don’t just function but *feel futuristic*.

## 💡 What Drives Me
Curiosity. I love exploring how code can bend visuals, speed, and logic together.  
For me, hackathons aren’t just competitions — they’re reality checks to see how far AI, creativity, and human logic can merge.
