## About

I'm a 24-year-old marketing professional deeply immersed in the Web3 space, with a passion for building and nurturing decentralized communities. What drives me is the transformative potential of blockchain and the power of engaged, collaborative communities in shaping the future of the internet.

My expertise lies in growing and managing Web3 communities, having scaled projects to impressive user bases. At Zealy, I helped boost our daily active users to over 250,000, with monthly active users surpassing 1.5 million. I thoroughly enjoy creating strategic content, designing engaging campaigns, and implementing community initiatives that resonate with crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike.

Now, with a product as promising as Glint Analytics, I'm positive the team and I can recreate the sense of a community, share insights for everyone and make this process so simple that everyone can begin their journey of analysing and understanding data.
