## About

I am a newbie web3 developer and for the past months I've been building mini-apps on base ecosystem. Recently got into the BuidlGuidl batch #21. 

I have made a few mini-apps I am proud of which are more on the fun and music utility side, even though they have not many users. But I hope to build one that pays me well and helps people in the process.
