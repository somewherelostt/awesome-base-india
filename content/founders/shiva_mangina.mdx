## About

Hi, I am **Shiva Kumar Mangina**, a 27-year-old Blockchain and Web developer living in Bangalore, India. I am a programmer by profession. I love to code in `JavaScript`. I am always excited to connect with like-minded people. Connect with me at `shiva2nani.mangina@gmail.com` 



> I believe coding is magic✨, The magic which enables us to create everything the world has never seen before.


Currently, I’m focused on *Blockchain*, decentralized human-centered products. *Finance* and playing with large Datasets to find patterns are my areas of interest apart from the *web*.
