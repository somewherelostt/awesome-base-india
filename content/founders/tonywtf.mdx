## About

I define myself as a Builder first.
For a long time, I had ideas for onchain applications but lacked the traditional tooling and knowledge to bring them to life. Agentic coding changed everything for me. It unlocked my ability to translate the logic in my head into working products.
This Onchain Checkers game is more than just a submission; it represents my transition from “thinking” to “shipping.”
 Every line of code in this project was written, tested, and deployed through a process of intense learning and iteration. I’m building in public, enjoying every bit of the challenge, and just getting started.
