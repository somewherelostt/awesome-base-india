## About

I am Omkar Darde, an undergrad student from IIT Roorkee. I have been in this blockchain domain for quite some time and I love to code in solidity and Like to Design related to Web3.0. I also cleared the screening round of **Summer Of Bitcoin**. Studying in this college delve me in various extracurricular activities like working as a Core Team member at BlockChain Society, group of Blockchain enthusiasts aiming to unite the blockchain community of IIT Roorkee, in a highly collaborative environment that is open for all. The Club has open collaborations on fun projects, and quirky discussions on crypto, Defi, Web3.0 and beyond.
