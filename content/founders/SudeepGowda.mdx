## About

Proactive Web3 Developer with a strong focus on Blockchain technology, boasting over two years of experience in crafting Full Stack Web3 applications using Golang, Rust, and advanced Blockchain frameworks. I also excel in managing Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployments, and streamlining CI-CD workflows on hybrid and public clouds like AWS, GCP, and Civo.

With a background in penetration testing, I bring a security-focused approach to development. My competitive spirit has been recognized through multiple hackathon wins, including EthGlobal Bangkok, EthTallin, and EthOnline 2024. I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the EV Sector.
