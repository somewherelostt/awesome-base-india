## About

# Hi there, I'm Atharv 👋

**👨‍💻 Creative Developer | Student | Tech Enthusiast**

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a developer who focuses on building clean, functional web applications and exploring the depths of AI/ML.

My portfolio lives at **[atharv.is-a-good.dev](https://atharv.is-a-good.dev)**.

> *It’s a subdomain because I prioritize efficiency (and spent my domain budget on coffee).*

  * **🌱 I’m currently learning:** Advanced AI integration.
  * **👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:** Innovative open-source projects and hackathons.
  * **💬 Ask me about:** React ecosystems, Python scripting, and why `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3` in JavaScript.
  * **⚡ Fun fact:** I believe 90% of coding is debugging, and the other 10% is writing bugs for the future.

## 📂 Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights from my journey so far:

### [Fractal](https://github.com/AtharvRG/fractal)

  * **Overview:** A multi-file code playground that compresses your entire project into a single URL hash. No database, just chaos and compression algorithms.
  * **Tech:** Next.js, Tree-sitter, Monaco Editor, Brotli compression.

### [Lemma](https://github.com/AtharvRG/lemma)

  * **Overview:** An in-browser time-travel debugger. Because regular debugging wasn't painful
