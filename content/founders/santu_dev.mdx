## About

I am a highly motivated Full-Stack Web Developer and AI enthusiast, currently in my second year of university. I specialize in designing, building, and deploying scalable web applications, seamlessly integrating AI-driven solutions to enhance functionality and efficiency.

With expertise in Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and SQL, I have a strong grasp of data structures, algorithms, computer networking, and operating systems. I am proficient in modern web frameworks such as React.js, Node.js, and Django, and I leverage tools like Git and Linux for efficient development workflows.

In the AI domain, I have hands-on experience with LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Generative AI, enabling the development of intelligent and context-aware applications.

Beyond technical skills, I excel in time management, workflow coordination, and fostering a collaborative team environment. My leadership, communication, and problem-solving abilities further empower me to drive innovation and efficiency in every project I undertake.
