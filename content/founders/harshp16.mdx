## About

I am currently in my 4th year at Bits pilani, Goa campus pursuing Computer science and economics.

I like to explore new fields like AI and Machine Learning and have started to build projects on them. I strongly believe in project-based learning as it is an efficient way to learn and test your skill at the same time. I am also interested in upcoming tech like virtual reality as I believe this is where the future is heading.
