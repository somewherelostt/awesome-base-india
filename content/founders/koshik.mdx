## About

Hey there, I'm a web3 enthusiast who holds a Master's degree in Computer
Science & Information Security. I have previously worked at RSA, a network
security company, and a couple of startups in Bangalore, India before Co-Founding a blockchain-based research and development lab – Consenso Labs. Currently building Safient.

I actively give talks and workshops on web3 technologies at local meetups. I'm an instructor for blockchain courses at Amity Online (https://amityonline.com). I have also authored a book on blockchain technology titled: Foundations of Blockchain.
