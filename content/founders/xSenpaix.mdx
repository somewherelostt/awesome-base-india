## About

A third-year Mathematics and Computing student at IIT Roorkee with a deep focus on Zero-Knowledge, Cryptography, and building within the Ethereum ecosystem.
My journey into the blockchain space began over two years ago and has since evolved into a focused, year-long deep dive into Zero-Knowledge proofs, applied cryptography and Ethereum Architecture.

-   **Academics:** Pursuing a BS-MS in Mathematics & Computing at IIT Roorkee, providing me with a strong theoretical foundation in algorithms, discrete mathematics, cryptography and computational theory.

-   **Fellowship:** Reciepient of Ethereum Protocol Fellowship cohort 6, currently working on benchmarking Ream Consensus Client's Beacon Chain and Lean Chain's State Transition Functions inside RiscZero, SP1, Jolt, Pico and Zisk. 

-   **Professional Experience:** Currently working as SWE at [**Enclave**](https://www.enclave.money/)

-   **Core Interests:** Beyond my primary focus on ZK, Cryptography, Ethereum and De-Fi I have a keen interest in quantitative finance, with hands-on experience in options pricing, yield curves, and market-making strategies. While working on ML Models and optimization techniquies in these projects, I have developed a profound interest in Artificial Intelligence as well. 

### Why Invisible Garden?

The ZK landscape is evolving at an incredible pace. While I've dedicated the past year to a deep dive into the field, I believe a focused, immersive environment is crucial to not only keep up but to contribute meaningfully.



I am confident that my background in mathematics and my practical experience in ZK development will allow me to contribute actively to the cohort, and I hope to leave with a tremendous amount of new knowledge and experience.

I feel zk space has been growing at an enormous pace and its difficult to keep up with all the developments. Invisible Garden would allow me to talk to and build connections with researchers and developers who have made a significant contribution t
