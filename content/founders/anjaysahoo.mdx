## About

**Since 2021**, I've been deeply engaged in the blockchain/web3 space, brimming with excitement for the technology it offers. While I serve as a **Software Engineer 2 at NCR Corporation**, specializing in web2 solutions, I've also been investing in my growth by enrolling in courses, participating in hackathons, and consistently creating within the dynamic world of blockchain/web3.


## Blockchain/Web3 Experience
1. Currently, I am working on a project [lensview.io](https://lensview.io/).

b. **[Winner of The Graph Pool Prize](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n7aCPS09W2Rtzc0DmNnXpNrwmaVEvTCp/view?usp=sharing)** in ETH India 2022 Hackathon

d. Followed by **[Stani Kulechov](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov)(Founder of Lens Protocol & Aave) **and many more on **[X](https://twitter.com/lensview_)**
e. Utilized **GraphQL** for APIs, **Puppeteer** for web scraping, **Redis** for queuing, **Ethers **for wallet connection, **Docker** for containerization, and **AWS** for hosting. [Github](https://github.com/BlockchainKami/lensview-beta)
