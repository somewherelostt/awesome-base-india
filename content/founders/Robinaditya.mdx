## About

# 👋 Hi, I’m Aditya Mahamuni

🚀 **Web3 Builder | Smart Contract Developer | Full-Stack Engineer**  
🎓 B.Tech CSE @ IIIT Lucknow (CGPA: 8.1)  
🇮🇳 Based in India

I’m a builder focused on creating **production-grade Web3 applications**, especially systems involving **economic incentives, real-time interactions, and decentralized ownership**. I actively participate in hackathons, enjoy rapid prototyping, and love shipping ideas that actually work on-chain.
