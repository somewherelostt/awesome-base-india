## About

Hi, my name is Sandesh Shinde and I'm thrilled to be participating in the hackathon competition. Being a freshman in Computer Engineering who is interested in technology I am now excitedly wander in the fields of technology.

At the moment, I am very fortunate and super excited to be an intern in front-end development, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Bootstrap daily. Via internship, you can give a hand to live operations wherein you learn to form attractive and appropriate interfaces.

Furthermore, I have solid knowledge in Python which wider limits of my responsibility going beyond frontend development.

I am all excited to partake in this hackathon, and here I have an opportunity to use my skills to the best of ability and collaborate with like-minded individuals to come up with innovations that solve real problems.
