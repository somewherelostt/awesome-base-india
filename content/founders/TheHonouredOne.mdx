## About

Hi 👋! My name is Sachin, Welcome to my Devfolio profile! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in CyberSecurity at Dayananda Sagar University.

I am a passionate software developer and builder with experience in Web3, AI, and full-stack development, based in Bangalore. My tech stack includes Next.js, React.js, Python, Solidity, and Ethereum, among others. I’ve participated in several hackathons, winning 5 hackathons and 1 Solana CTF, which gave me hands-on experience in rapid prototyping and problem-solving. Beyond coding, I’m also a tech and startup enthusiast, constantly exploring how emerging technologies can create real-world impact.
