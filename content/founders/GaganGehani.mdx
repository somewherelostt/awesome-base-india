## About

Tech product manager for 7+ years. Ex-Coinbase, most recently was building a crypto browser FT.

A generalist in my day job but like to build hands on, recent side projects:

dataDiveAI (@DataDiveAI) / X

https://web.telegram.org/k/#@ChatRadarAIBot - 1 command summary of unread messages plus topic alerts across chats - think google news alerts but for chats.

I am maximising my time building in the space FT, seeing this hackathon as an opportunity to build and launch a product with a platform/distribution.
