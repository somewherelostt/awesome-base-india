### Distinctions and Honors

- **Academic and Entrepreneurial Recognition**: Mohit has been acknowledged across academic circles for his exceptional hacking skills, while Tarusha was awarded a Gold Medal by IIT Delhi's Women Entrepreneurship and Empowerment program for her contributions to advancing women in technology.

- **Global Representatives**: We received the coveted Next Big Idea 2017 award and represented India at the 1776 Challenge, where we presented our innovative solutions to a global audience.

### Contributions to the Tech Ecosystem

- **Mentorship and Leadership**: Beyond our business ventures, we're dedicated to fostering the next generation of technology leaders. Tarusha drives influential discussions through her podcast "Living on Blockchain," and together, we're active angel investors in over 40 companies.
