## About

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast who loves building and breaking systems to make them stronger. My focus is on network defense, automation, and ethical hacking, and I enjoy turning complex security concepts into practical solutions. I like working on projects that push boundaries, mix creativity with logic, and solve real-world problems.
