## About

Hello my name is **Hrishique Munshi** an ordinary engineer from **IT** background who is willing to do some extra ordinary projects with the help of polygon blockchain by moving into **WEB3**.
Currently I am **Java Backenend** Developer Working for TCS for past 1 year and 2 months well versed with coding standards and working in a team also can perfom individually if needed and willing to move into blockchain development for full time as well as some side hustles.
For TCS currently working on Java Spring Technology on a healthcare project where my role is to create** industry level API's using SpringBoot and hibernate ** and developing test cases using Junit and spock on top of Groovy framework.
The zeal and dopamine rush I get after solving any problem assigned to me is the best feeling and motivates me to solve more problems over and over again.
