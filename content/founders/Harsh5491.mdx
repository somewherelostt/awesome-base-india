## About

Hi, I'm Harsh—a front-end developer with a passion for crafting functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. With hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hackathons excite me because they allow me to push my boundaries, connect with innovative minds, and create solutions that make an impact. I'm eager to contribute my skills, learn from others, and make the most of this experience!
