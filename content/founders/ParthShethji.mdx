## About

Web3 and AI Engineer with 2.5+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-impact decentralized systems and agentic AI solutions. I am a winner at EthMumbai, DeFi Mania, and Hackpiration, and have led the development of innovative products at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence.

I have built groundbreaking projects such as PeosFi, a protocol enabling uncollateralized borrowing on-chain, and SmartSync, a Web2–Web3 bridge that dynamically generates and adapts smart contracts using large language models. My work focuses on designing and deploying secure, scalable DApps and smart contracts on Ethereum.

As an AI Engineer, I actively build agentic workflows and multi-agent systems, integrating deep learning and generative AI into decentralized applications. My expertise spans blockchain architecture, full-stack development, and intelligent automation, enabling me to deliver impact-driven solutions across finance, healthcare, and emerging digital ecosystems.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise into Move and Rust to build next-generation, high-performance blockchain infrastructure.
