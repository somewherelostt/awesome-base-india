## About

Passionate software developer. Currently in my fourth year of Engineering. My interests include Blockchain Technology, web development and databases.
- My journey through technology began with a love for Python, which eventually led me into the world of web development. With a strong foundation in Django and Flask, I mastered various aspects like Jinja templating, REST/gRPC APIs, and database management. Most of my projects were built using these frameworks, demonstrating my commitment to web development.
-  My ambitions reach beyond traditional web development. The Crime Bound Token project introduced me to the Ethereum ecosystem, igniting my passion for blockchain and Web3. I'm eager to contribute impactful code, collaborate with talented peers, and explore how blockchain technology can revolutionize industries and solve real-world challenges.

The **projects** I've built are:
**1.)Dogs Network:** Since June 2022, I've been actively involved in Dogs Network, a web app connecting users with street dogs by location. I've crafted a robust **Rest API** using Django Rest Framework, managed data with Django **ORM**, and ensured smooth data conversion using Serializers for JSON rendering. Deployment on **AWS EC2** with RDS database management and Swagger API documentation streamlines accessibility. Technologies include **Django, Django Rest Framework, Bootstrap, SQLite, HTML, Swagger, and Jinja2**, creating a user-friendly platform for canine connections.
**2.) Crime Bound Token:** Crime Bound Token, a product of the **ETHIndia2022 Hackathon**, is designed to meticulously monitor criminal records through the implementation of Non-Transferable **ERC721** tokens. These unique tokens can only be minted once and hold an unchangeable status, making them valuable identity markers within the system. As a testament to its innovation, the project mirrors crime records as NFTs in the criminal's wallet. The development stack includes React, **EthersJS, IPFS, Solidity**, and **Hardh
