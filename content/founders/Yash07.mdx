## About

I’m an execution driven Web3 builder currently studying data science, with hands on experience across Ethereum and the Base ecosystem. I’ve been selected for multiple international ETH hackathons and have participated in several quantitative competitions, which has strengthened my ability to work under pressure and build fast. I enjoy learning by building, collaborating with driven teams, and turning ideas into real products. I’m excited to contribute and build something meaningful at ETHMumbai.
