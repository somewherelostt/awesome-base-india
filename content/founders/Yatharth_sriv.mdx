## About

I am currently a second year student at BITS GOA . I am a full stackdeveloper with a bit of knowledge of web3 space . Defi dapps always make me exicted. I have built a ecommerce website with the integration of wallet(metamask obvio).Backend development is my true love i have more projects in backend than frontend because it is more fun . I recently built a youtube kind of a blog app backend which was quite exicting and energy draining but it was fun at the end.
