## About

I am an undergraduate student at Bennett University, India. I am familiar with working on MERN stack and also have some working knowledge of Vue.js.

Apart from Web Development, I have solid foundations of Python.

Curiosity has been my biggest teacher. I explore the internet to learn techniques and best practices, and according to me formal education just slowed this process of self-learning. I spend a lot of my time learning things that interest me. Be it new tools, new languages, frameworks, vanilla code or design practices. The remaining in implementation and taking feedback from real users. Sleepless nights for pushing an update, that’s what I live for.
