## About

Hey, im Shikhar, Full Stack Web3 Engineer - love to build projects and learn new things. earlier worked at Funding The Commons as Lead Web3 Developer, NexusFi , DecenLabs. Been in the space from last 4+ years. I had been a core member of Polygon Guild Lucknow, an active Developer DAO #1265 member, Buildspace N&W S1 fellow, mentor at ETHToranto23, apart from it - won 25+ web3 hackathons like  Polygon BuiltIT 2021, ETHGlobal ETHOnline, Ethernals 2022, ETHIndia2023 etc.

From last 2 years, I have been actively exploring the privacy/ ZK focussed tech within Ethereum ecosystem. Worked with Mina team on development of Mina Based poker game using ZK proofs earlier. Apart from it, worked on Flux Wallet ( https://github.com/FluxWallet/flux-web-wallet) a 2FA based ERC4337 wallet which uses ZK proofs under the hood for otp verification. Last year, I build NebulaID(https://nebulaid.xyz/ - Universal Identity Protocol ) at ETHKL which won prizes at PSE track for the use of TLSNotary & Semaphore. Later worked on the extension of NebulaID. Built SocialMPC at ETHIndia24(https://devfolio.co/projects/socialmpc-bdfc) and won PSE track under MPC Framework/Cursive. Recently worked on MPC based mini apps eg MPC Fire Water (https://x.com/0xShikhar/status/1961492675883872636) and also got it live on MPC Showcase page (https://mpc.pse.dev/showcase). Working on few cool ideas about MPC and ZK currently.
