## About

Hi, I'm Aafreen. 
I am a **content writer** and an **amateur developer**, that is to say I'm learning programming right now. I joined SheFi Cohort 14 which is how I got introduced to Web3, Blockchain, and DeFi. And it pulled me in, so at present I'm learning *Solidity for fun* and *C++*, both because it's a little fun and my college demands it.
I'm in BTech CSE 2nd year at present and my most employable skill today might be content writing. I've been writing since I was in grade 2, first for school magazine, then for city newspaper articles and some competitions soon after. *I recently won a magazine making competition and a poetry writing competition*. During my first year of engineering, I explored **robotics and automation**. I made both fun and novel projects using ESP32 and Arduino, from lights that switch on when you pass by to fire alarm sensors to work in extreme cases such as hospital fires.
I am also an anchor/host for both podcasts and live events and I love to research and deep dive into new things, tech or otherwise. I am working on a research paper right now that ties Blockchain and Industry 5.0 with Robotics and Automation.
Lastly, I love to read fiction, if I'm quiet and looking into my phone, I'm probably reading an Ebook.
