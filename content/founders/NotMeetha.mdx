## About

HI, I’m a sophomore at IIT Roorkee, and over the past year I’ve been deeply exploring the Web3 ecosystem—contributing to open-source projects, building privacy-focused tools, and experimenting with DeFi applications. Along the way, I’ve also won a few hackathons, which further fueled my interest in creating verifiable, user-centric systems. I enjoy reading the latest research in cryptography, distributed systems, and blockchain scalability, and I often try to implement these ideas in practice or contribute to the projects that inspire me.
