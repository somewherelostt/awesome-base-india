## About

hey!

im Hano and I ship things in web3 and im actively building products. Outside of this, I actively host and organize hackathons, bringing together developers, ideas, and communities. At my core, I’m an avid builder with a deep love for Web3 whether it’s experimenting with decentralized communication or ICP canisters, or new Ethereum dApps, I enjoy exploring how technology can push boundaries and create real impact. Over time, I’ve specialized in cybersec, while continuing to expand my expertise across the broader blockchain landscape. I'm actively looking for Web3 buildathons where I could ship something

And yes, that’s how I landed up here.
