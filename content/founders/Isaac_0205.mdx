## About

I'm Isaac Sam Alex, a 3rd year BTech student at DSATM. I am an enthusiastic learner passionate about expanding my knowledge through real-world tech challenges. I greatly enjoy being part of hackathons, both as a participant and as an organizer, and I'm excited by the idea of hosting future hackathons at my campus. My journey is driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to creating impactful tech solutions.
