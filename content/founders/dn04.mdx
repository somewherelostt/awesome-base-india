## About

JAY SHRI KRISHNA! Myself Durgesh Narayan Nayak pursuing 1st year B.Tech in CSE-AI&ML. I am a person who can be mold according to need. I am eager to learn new things and implement it to get some output. In terms of programming language i am familiar with Python , mySQL , C,C++ ,I also know basics of HTML and CSS. I am now learning JavaScript and Java . I want to explore more in this field by applying whatever i learned in coding in real life i want to give my codes a life , a reason to be remebered , I want to make them functional such that it helps our society . I want to contribute something meaningful to our world. Reason behind choosing healtcare is we may achieve everything in life but we can only enjoy the luxury until our body allows . So it is important to keep our health in track . To have a systematic management of our health report and a reminder for medicines and health checkup we came with this idea to build this management and health tracker web app.

This is my first project i am contributing to , so i am ready to put all my efforts to it to learn and to achieve my goals.
