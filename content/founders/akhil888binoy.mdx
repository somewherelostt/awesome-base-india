## About

I am a blockchain developer specializing in Rust and Solidity, with extensive experience in DeFi, smart contract development, and exchange infrastructure. Currently, I’m working at a company building a crypto exchange, where I contribute to the development of secure, scalable, and efficient blockchain solutions.

With 9 hackathon wins, I have a track record of building innovative decentralized applications, from DeFi protocols to cross-chain solutions. My passion lies in creating high-performance blockchain systems, smart contract automation, and on-chain financial primitives.
