## About

I am a backend web developer with a focus on Solidity and Smart Contracts since 2020 and have been in the Ethereum ecosystem for about 3 years now. I closely follow everything happening inside Ethereum. I have a few projects of my own and I love talking about new ideas and applications of Ethereum and other public, open, and permissionless blockchains.

- Currently building **[lensview.io](https://lensview.io)** on Lens Protocol.

- The Graph Pool Prize Winner at ETHIndia2022 with LensView.

- LensView is followed by Stani Kulechov (Founder of Lens Protocol & Aave) and many more on X.

- Road To Web3 (ETHGlobal Hackathon) - **[Polygon Pool Prize Winner](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n7aCPS09W2Rtzc0DmNnXpNrwmaVEvTCp/view)** with project ChessBet.

- Buildsquest (ETH Global Hackathon) - Showcased project **[Quizzer](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/buildquest/quizzer-54e8z)**.

- Buildspace Nights & Weekend **[S3](https://buildspace.so/s3/demoday/LensView)** & **[S4](https://buildspace.so/s4/demoday/lensview)**: Taking LensView to the next level with every new season.
