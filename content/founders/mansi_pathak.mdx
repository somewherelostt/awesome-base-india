## About

Greetings!
I am Mansi Pathak, a third year bachelors student currently pursuing Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. 
I have a a strong interest in backend development, AI-driven systems, model development and working with data, i.e analytics.
I enjoy building scalable and practical solutions, especially for real-world problem statements. I have experience working with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, and have integrated many AI models into my projects.
I’ve led and contributed to multiple projects, where I handled research, backend logic, and data modeling.
