## About

I consider myself good at developing innovative applications. I have a strong passion to make a full-fledged application right from scratch. One of my most complex projects was to create a machine learning-based platform to diagnose diseases from the symptoms of the user. I also have been worked on Flutter for the past year. I have a stronghold on Dynamically typed language such as python and on object-oriented language such as java. I have also explored the side of competitive programming on platforms such as codechef and codewars. Recently, I have been working in the domain of FinTech and developing applications with the use of blockchain and machine learning.
