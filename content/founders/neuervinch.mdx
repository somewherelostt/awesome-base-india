## About

I’m Naveen, a full-stack developer and blockchain enthusiast focused on building high-performance Web3 and AI-native applications.

My core stack includes React, Next.js, Node.js, Solidity, and modern Web3 tooling like ethers.js, RainbowKit, Wagmi, IPFS, Arweave, and ZK frameworks (Noir). I’ve worked on projects spanning DeFi, real-time multiplayer games, AI-powered agents, prediction markets, decentralised storage, and DAO tooling.

I’m particularly interested in combining AI, blockchain, and real-time systems to create meaningful user experiences—whether that’s on-chain gaming, AI-driven markets, or privacy-preserving applications. Hackathons are where I experiment, learn fast, and ship ideas that can scale to production.
