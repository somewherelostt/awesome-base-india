## About

I am a versatile developer with expertise in C++ and Python, along with a creative flair for design. My programming skills extend to C, Java, and JavaScript. I've contributed to the development of a dairy products e-commerce Android app. With a portfolio that includes four small scale web apps and one Android app, I combine technical proficiency with an eye for aesthetics. I have undertaken freelance projects, crafting unique brand kits for small businesses. Beyond coding and design, I'm an avid chess player, passionate about the game as a hobby.
