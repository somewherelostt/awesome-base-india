## About

I’m a Cybersecurity Researcher and Penetration Tester with a passion for both Web2 and Web3 security and backend development. Over the years, I’ve reported 300+ verified vulnerabilities, disclosed high-severity CVEs, and ranked among the Top 100 global researchers on Yogosha.

With a strong foundation in offensive security and secure DevOps, I’ve spent a year as a Penetration Testing Intern at Security Lit, conducting assessments across web, mobile, and API environments. My focus now is on building secure systems while exploring Web3-driven security solutions.

Highlights include:

🛡️ CVE-2025-48053 — high-severity bug in Discourse
🥇 ETHIndia 2024 & ETHGlobal 2025 Winner
💰 $15,000+ in bounty rewards
🏆 Featured on Microsoft Leaderboard (2024)

My recent projects — Myrad (Data DAO) and Oswald (Smart Contract Auditing & Web3 CI/CD) — merge cybersecurity with blockchain and backend engineering, showcasing how decentralized systems can be both scalable and secure.

Currently in my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at MAKAUT, I also serve as the Google Developer Group Cybersecurity Lead. Always open to collaboration in security research, Web3 development, or backend engineering that drives meaningful impact.
