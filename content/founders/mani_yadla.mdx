## About

Hello there! I'm Mani,
Currently, I am pursuing B.Tech at CVR College of Engineering. The field of technology has always captivated me, and I am constantly amazed by the transformative power it holds. My experience includes working with Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Web Development using HTML and CSS, as well as using the Linux operating system. Any skills I may lack are compensated by my unwavering determination to learn. I have a genuine passion for problem-solving and actively participate in competitive programming contests. I am also enthusiastic about creating new projects and expanding my network by connecting with new individuals. Feel free to connect with me here on LinkedIn.
