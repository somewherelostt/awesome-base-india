## About

Hello, I am Sunny. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer science in May - 2018.

I have been working in blockchain space since 2018. Initially started with solidity and web3.js. Now, Worked on many Decentralized finance protocols like Uniswap, Kyber, MakerDao, 0x, AAVE and Compound. Even also worked on Gas-less or Meta-Transaction for ethereum dapp using Biconomy-mexa SDK.
