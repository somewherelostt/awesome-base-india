## About

I am an experienced Farcaster developer with a proven track record of innovation and success. Over the past four months, I have immersed myself in the Farcaster ecosystem, creating more than 10 frames, developing a client, and building a social media manager. My dedication and skills were recognized when I won in the Payments Track in the Summercamp hackathon.
Currently, I am exploring several promising ideas for Moxie. Participating in the Moxie hackathon would provide the perfect opportunity to bring these concepts to life. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to the Moxie community and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
