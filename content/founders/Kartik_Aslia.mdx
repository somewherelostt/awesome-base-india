## About

I am Kartik Aslia, an innovative and dedicated Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in enhancing machine learning models and implementing advanced AI techniques. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering at Chandigarh University. My expertise lies in fine-tuning Large Language Models, optimizing database management systems, and developing robust backend solutions.

I have successfully led projects that boosted accuracy, reduced costs, and improved efficiency. Notably, I enhanced itinerary creation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-RAG, developed a vector database for Ayurvedic literature, and implemented a custom data structure for hospital user information. My skills in machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and backend development, coupled with a strong sense of leadership and collaboration, drive my commitment to efficiency and innovation. I am passionate about making impactful contributions to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
