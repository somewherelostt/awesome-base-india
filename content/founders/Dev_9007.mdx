## About

Hello, I'm ***Devang Gandhi***, currently studying at AISSMS IOIT in Pune, Maharashtra. I'm a passionate builder and developer who continuously ships on-chain applications that solve real-world problems by reducing **latency,** increasing **transparency**, and making systems more reliable and user-friendly.

 I started building in Web2, but the saturation and lack of transparency led me to explore Web3.
 I've been connected with the great **FBI **(Farcaster Builders International) group from last 3 months, which has been supporting builders like me in developing on-chain applications the folks in the community are like **crazyyy**. 

I really connect with this field because it emphasizes ownership and transparency, which is exactly in proportion with my values and building style.

I've successfully launched [BUGCHAN](https://www.bugchan.xyz/) , a fully decentralized bug bounty platform. We won a partner prize at **ETHGlobal** for integrating Blockscout as our blockchain explorer. Beyond that, I've developed several mini-applications focused on DAOs, voting systems, and decentralizing real estate transactions including establishing a Right of Way process for that market. I'm committed to building more solutions in this space.

Outside of development, I am a **pianist** practicing piano from 12 years and currently mentor at a music academy, where I've taught over 200 students.

I'm now actively documenting my learning journey the challenges I face and the solutions I develop to help other builders avoid the mistakes I made and accelerate their own growth.
I believe in the principle: **For the Ecosystem, By the Ecosystem (Web3)**.
