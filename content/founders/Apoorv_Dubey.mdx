## About

I’m an enthusiastic developer and a student at IIT BHU with a strong passion for building products that blend creativity, problem-solving, and technology.
💻 Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience across Web2 and Web3, and I enjoy taking an idea from scratch all the way to a fully functional application.
