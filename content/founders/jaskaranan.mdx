## About

Hello!

I'm thrilled to be part of this hackathon! I am a passionate developer with a strong focus on decentralized finance (DeFi). With a solid foundation in Foundry and Hardhat, I bring deep expertise in smart contract development. My technical skill set includes proficiency in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Python programming. I have hands-on experience with SQL databases and MS Data Studio, which allows me to manage and analyze data efficiently.

Beyond my technical skills, I'm a collaborative team player who thrives in dynamic environments. I enjoy working with others to brainstorm innovative solutions and tackle challenges head-on. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and work alongside other talented individuals during this hackathon.

My most recent exciting projects include building an algorithmic stable coin(this was a hell yeah project for me) , flash loans, staking, lending pools.

Let's build something amazing together!

Best regards,
Jaskaran Singh
