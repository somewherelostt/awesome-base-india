## About

hi,

i design, build and break things. i started coding when i was 12 and made the first internet dollars by writing blogs on gta cheatcodes. i also love bikes and hikes.
i have interests in ai, blockchain, games, zk and robotics. i'm a firm believer that ai + robotics will make disability accessible. i've won more than 15 hackathons.
