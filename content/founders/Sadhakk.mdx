## About

I'm Sadhak Kumar, a full-stack web developer and flutter application developer with experience building responsive and user-friendly applications. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Honors in Blockchain from Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology and have a passion for coding and problem-solving.

I have extensive experience working with a wide range of technologies, including the MERN stack and Next.js for web development, Flutter for mobile application development, Solidity & Ethers.js for blockchain development, and many other cutting-edge technologies, and developed and maintained several e-commerce websites, CRM systems, and custom web applications for clients from various industries.

I'm a detail-oriented developer who enjoys working in a team environment and collaborating with designers and project managers to deliver high-quality products. I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Football, reading tech blogs, and attending local developer meetups to network with fellow developers.
