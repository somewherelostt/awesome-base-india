## About

Hi, My name is Sachin. I've been writing code in C++ since I was in 16. I started with a traditional CS Education from school which sucked because they taught me turbo c++, but I decided I couldn't take this shit anymore. 

So I started writing code in java, python and even built a projects that helped school teachers. I got into web3 last year. 

I want to attend this because I like to challenge myself to build innovative solutions under limited time frame, because I'm really passionate about programming and I love what I do and I think this way I get to learn more, meet other nerds like me and have a vacation as well.
