## About

Hey, I am Abhinav G Krishna an electronics engineering student turned a fellow hacker. As a recent engineering graduate from Govt. Model Engineering College Thrikkakara I spent a lot of time tinkering with electronics of various kinds:  Flip Flops, microcomputers/microntrollers, FPGAs amongst others. My final graduation project (S.H.I.E.L.D) was an autonomous emergency response vehicle controlled remotely using raspberry pi. It was built using web sockets, python, next js. 
I am also a blockchain enthusiast who has just started out participating in several blockchain hackthons conducted by ethglobal/devfolio.
