## About

I’m someone who enjoys exploring how different technologies can come together to solve real-world problems. Lately, I’ve been focused on blockchain, full-stack development, and AI, especially where they intersect with sustainability. One of my main projects, sustAIn, uses AI to help design eco-friendly materials, which reflects how I like to approach tech: not just building cool things, but building with purpose.

I’m drawn to decentralized systems, open tools, and anything that encourages experimentation. Whether it’s developing an app, digging into a new framework, or just learning something unexpected, I’m always trying to push ideas a little further and see where they go.
