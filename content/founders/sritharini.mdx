## About

As SEO & Influencer Marketing Manager at Crypto Marketing Agency since 2021, I’ve driven digital growth through targeted SEO, influencer management, and strategic outreach. Leveraging Python, I scraped data on 3,000+ influencers across platforms, focusing on niche-based targeting to enhance campaign precision and engagement. I also used Python for outreach and Telegram member scraping, efficiently adding members to groups to support community expansion.

I led social media management efforts, boosting community interaction through well-executed content strategies and quest platform engagement. My expertise in on-page SEO, keyword research, and link building has consistently increased traffic and search visibility.

With strong skills in influencer recruitment, content collaboration, SEO audits, and performance tracking, I bring a data-driven approach to digital campaigns. My toolkit includes Google Analytics, Ahrefs, SEMrush, and other industry tools, ensuring optimized strategies that boost visibility and engagement in the dynamic Web3 landscape.As SEO & Influencer Marketing Manager at Crypto Marketing Agency since 2021, I’ve driven digital growth through targeted SEO, influencer management, and strategic outreach.
