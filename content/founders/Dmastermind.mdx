## About

I'm not your typical founder. In high school, I was building 7-foot wingspan delivery drones and running a food delivery service that caught the FAA's attention which ultimately helped shape new drone regulations. That experience taught me early that if you're going to push boundaries, you better be ready to deal with the consequences and make your case convincingly.

I dropped out of Cal Poly Engineering in 2021 to pursue Aquari full-time because I couldn't shake the feeling that the entire non-profit sector was fundamentally broken. Why are we okay with volunteers working for free while donors get zero return on impact investments? 
It made no sense to me. Reading Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations Helped Me Form this Perspective".

Four years later, I've mobilized 11,000+ paying supporters across three continents and generated $417,000 in revenue - all bootstrapped, all proving that you can make environmental work profitable for everyone involved. From Mumbai river cleanups to Netherlands community events where people drive 2+ hours for token rewards, I've learned that people will show up for meaningful work when there's real value exchange.

My background spans computer engineering and social economics, but honestly, the most important skill I've developed is getting people to believe in seemingly impossible ideas and then making them happen. Whether it's convincing regulators, coordinating international cleanups, or building token economies that actually work - I've learned that execution beats perfection every time.

Currently expanding Aquari across Africa, starting with Nigeria where we've deployed 45+ cleaners in our first month. Still building, still learning, still proving that blockchain can solve real problems.
