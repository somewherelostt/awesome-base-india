## About

I have done my majors in mathematics and computer science from IIT Guwahati. Fascinated by the idea of decentralization and white paper on bitcoin, I started my BTP on “Decentralisation and Cryptocurrencies”. 
Since then, I have been expanding my horizons personally and professionally into the decentralized universe. I have been associated with Mphasis, FICO, and CoinDCX as a blockchain engineer, where I have been researching and developing blockchain-based applications. 
I am a huge believer in decentralization and my career progression has been tracing the same path. I have had the chance to work on Hyperledger, Ethereum & Solana ecosystems so far. I have expertise in backend/smart-contract/scripting development. I have developed applications based on e-KYC, Task Management, Ticketing, Chain Scanning, and Payment Streaming. Currently, I am building conditional utility transfer for any NFT.
