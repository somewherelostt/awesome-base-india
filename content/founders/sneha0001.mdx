## About

I’m Sneha Gupta, a Full Stack (MERN) developer who graduated in July 2024. I’m currently working at a Web3 startup, focusing on backend and SDK development, along with frontend smart contract integration. Previously, I interned at Zoth and also gained experience as a Backend and ML intern at Web2 startups. Additionally, I’ve won 15+ Web3 hackathons. I also have worked with Meowfi as a smart contract dev.
