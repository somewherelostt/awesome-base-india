## About

## 🌐 Who I Am

I’m **Arijit**, a blockchain developer and engineering student at **The LNMIIT**, deeply immersed in the Web3 space for the past year. From smart contract engineering to DeFi mechanics, I’ve been continuously exploring how decentralized systems reshape technology and finance.

## 🚀 My Journey into Web3

What started as curiosity quickly evolved into a full-fledged passion for decentralized technology. Over the past year, I’ve:

* Built projects across **Solidity**, **Move**, and other smart contract ecosystems.
* Participated in and organized **Web3 hackathons and workshops**.
* Explored **DeFi**, **AMMs**, **yield vaults**, **cross-chain bridges**, and **tokenization frameworks**.

Today, I’m focused on building systems that push the boundaries of decentralized finance.

* **AMM mathematics** — invariant functions, liquidity provision, and arbitrage dynamics.
* **RWA tokenization** — fractional ownership, collateralization, on-chain credit.
* **Authentication systems** — secure JWT flows with HttpOnly cookie architecture.
* **System integrations** — combining real-world processes with on-chain automation.
