## About

A full-stack developer handles both front-end (UI/UX) and back-end (server, database) development. They work with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular) for front-end and Node.js, Python, Java, or databases (SQL, MongoDB) for back-end. They manage APIs, deployment, and ensure seamless application functionality.
