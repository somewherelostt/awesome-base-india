## About

I'm a first-year Bachelor's student at Golden Gate University with a strong interest in web development and data structures & algorithms (DSA). While I'm still building my portfolio, I've actively honed my skills by independently creating clones of popular platforms like Netflix and Spotify. This experience gave me hands-on practice with front-end development and user interface design.

Additionally, I've completed two capstone projects during my academic studies, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. I'm eager to learn from experienced developers and collaborate with a team to tackle new challenges.
