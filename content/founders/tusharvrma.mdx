## About

I am a 18y/o with interest in building cool stuff on web. I love connecting real-life problems to programming,  communicate with people from different teams, or build applications from different industries.

Coming to my tech stack, I have experience of building stuff with Frontend technologies including libraries like React and frameworks Next and Tailwind. I have also gotten my hands dirty on web3 smart contract integration within web apps to make them a fully-functional dApp.

Keen for:

:- Building visually appealing websites
:- developing AI tools and agents on multiple platforms
:-Open Source
:- Study about Science and Space
:-messing with web3 stuff

I am an eager learner in the field of development, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Recently been working with smart contract development and making concepts stronger in web3 and building more cool stuff on Farcaster!
