## About

I possess a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications, which was successfully conferred in 2022. Presently, I am engaged as a **blockchain developer**, leveraging my expertise in Ethereum, Polygon, Livepeer, PUSH, XMTP, and The Graph, alongside other web3 protocols. Through my involvement in blockchain development, I have gained extensive experience by actively contributing to diverse projects and cultivating a profound comprehension of the underlying technology and its potential applications. Moreover, I have actively participated in renowned web3 hackathons, including Encode club, EthGlobal, and Chainlink hackathons, where I have effectively demonstrated my competencies and fostered collaborative relationships with fellow developers within the community.
