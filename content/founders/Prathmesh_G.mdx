## About

Hey, I have built a few apps on flutter, I started learning flutter half an year ago, I have also done various courses on data analysis with python and I am adept at python, apart from that, I can also code in c, c++ and java. I enjoy coding, problem solving and doing other creative work (Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Adobe Illustrator, Blender etc. )
