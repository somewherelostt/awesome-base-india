## About

Hi! myself Harrish Bansal , i am a freshman at IIT roorkee, pursuing my btech in Production and Industrial engineering. i always have been a great admirer of the blockchain technology. i was always fascinated by this concept and now through this hackathon i would like to explore more about blockchain by building a blockchain based project. i hope i got recruited to blocsoc iitr so that i can meet with likeminded pepole and can help myself explore this field under the guidance of seniors.
