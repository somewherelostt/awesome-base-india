## About

When I was just seven years old, I discovered the world of computers and I was immediately hooked. I loved exploring everything about them, from writing simple calculators to understanding how peer-to-peer systems worked for downloading data from the internet. As I got older, I started delving deeper into the world of technology, exploring cybersecurity, machine learning and development.

In college, my focus shifted from just learning new technologies to problem-solving and finding the best solutions for specific problems. It was during a college hackathon that I was first introduced to blockchain. I developed an e-voting system for Indian elections using ATM machines and biometric validation, using Gnache to locally host the Ethereum blockchain and Metamask as the signing wallet.

It was during this project that I fell in love with blockchain technology. From then on, I dedicated myself to learning more about web3 development and how to balance the use of both centralized and decentralized systems to achieve the best outcome.

Today, I work as an Analyst Consultant for McKinsey, where I provide analysis and develop systems and architectures for MNCs. I believe that the combination of AI, Web3, XR, and advancements in computing such as quantum and analog computing will revolutionize the world in major ways, and I am determined to be a part of that change.
