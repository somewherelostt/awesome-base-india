## About

I am an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
I have a deep interest in blockchain technology due to its numerous applications and how it will transform various industries by decentralization, transparency and immutability.
I am currently working as a Mentee in Hyperledger Mentorship Program by the Linux Foundation, where I am collaborating in an open-source community. I also have experience working on Ethereum.
