## About

I am a software developer who is exploring the web3 space.
I have been working on the Ethereum Blockchain for a long time.  I have made a few Defi and NFT projects. I am good with Solidity, ReactJS, Django, Javascript, Python, NextJS and Low-Code development.
Working towards decentralization and solving problems drives me. On top of that, it's building great products makes me happy.
I have made a crowdfunding app, an ICO sale project and a Uniswap clone. Have contributed to e-commerce app and NFT projects.I
