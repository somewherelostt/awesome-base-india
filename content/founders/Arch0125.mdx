## About

gm Everyone,
Archisman here, I'm currently diving into the world of Decentralised Finance and exploring different aspects of it, the ways it can be made more accessible to the users, more secure and efficient that its current state. Mainly my focus has been working on payment streams for which I'm working on implementations of EIP-1620 to make ERC20 native streams. Also trying to make under-collateralised loans as safe as possible using the magic of streams. The above which is the base of the current project I'm buidling.

A bit about how i got into web3, it's almost a year and a half back when i stumbled across various YouTube channels regarding Blockchain development which caught my attention being a new and growing industry, and it has been a great journey since then. Going to hackathons (winning many of them subtle flex 😝 ), attending meet-ups, meeting some the amazing people. Web3 ecosystem has really helped me to grow as a developer and hugely thankful for it.

Regarding my academics, Im currently in 2nd year of my B.Tech in CSE from SRM University,Chennai.
