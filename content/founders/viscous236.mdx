## About

I’m Vaibhav Goyal, a passionate blockchain and full-stack developer focused on building impactful decentralized systems. 
I enjoy exploring advanced concepts in DeFi, cross-chain interoperability, and onchain automation through hands-on projects and research. 
My experience spans developing innovative solutions like cross-chain auctions, RWA financing platforms, and liquidity optimization mechanisms. 
I’m always driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the goal of creating scalable, real-world Web3 applications.
