## About

Computer Science enthusiast with a strong background in backend development, decentralized networks, and Web3 technologies. I have participated in multiple Web3 hackathons, winning six, with experience spanning frontend development, integration, and smart contract creation. My technical expertise includes building robust backend systems in Node.js, Python, and Go, and tackling complex network projects.

I’ve developed a range of high-impact backend solutions, from an HTTP/0.9 server to an advanced load balancer with caching, security, and rate-limiting features. Additionally, I’m exploring decentralized projects like a rendering system on Polkadot and infrastructure improvements for Ethereum.

I’m excited about opportunities that allow me to create scalable, secure systems and push the boundaries of Web3 technology. If you’re looking for someone who’s passionate, innovative, and always ready to take on a challenge, let’s connect!
