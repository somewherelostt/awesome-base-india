## About

Hi there, I am a **first-year student** pursuing a bachelor's degree in **computer science and engineering**. I received 98% and 90%, respectively, in my final grades of 10 and 12 from the **Central Board of Secondary Education**. I am a tech geek enthusiast who loves to learn new things, but my ultimate goal is to simplify people's daily tasks by learning something new in my field every day. Anyone can learn anything at any age because, in my opinion, learning never ends until the end of one's life. My sole objective is to acquire new skills and bring happiness to others by creating something new for them.
