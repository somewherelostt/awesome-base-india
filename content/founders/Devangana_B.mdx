## About

As a computer engineering student with a passion for innovation, I have always been drawn to the world of technology. I have honed my skills in Programming and mobile App Development.

As a lifelong learner, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skillset. I am well-versed in Flutter, Java, Dart, Firebase, C, Blockchain (Solidity), Python, Android Studio, MERN Stack, etc. and I'm comfortable working with a variety of programming languages and tools. I have proficiency in UI/UX designing on Figma. Adding to that I have worked on Premiere Pro, Photoshop and Canva.

The ability to think outside the box and approach problems with a creative mindset has earned me recognition from peers and supervisors alike.

I am an active member of GDSC-VESIT (as the Flutter Lead) and ISTE-VESIT, and I have volunteered at several events and hackathons. Outside of work, I like to sketch, dance, paint, read, and travel. 

In addition to my technical skills, I'm a strong communicator who can convert complicated technical concepts into understandable plain language for stakeholders. I am also quite curious and am constantly looking to learn more about emerging technologies and how they may be used to tackle real-world issues.

I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology and to make a positive impact on the world.
