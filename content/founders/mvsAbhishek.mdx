## About

I’m a software developer with over four years of experience building and scaling distributed systems across Golang, Node.js, and Python. Over the last year, I’ve been deeply involved in blockchain development, working with Ethereum, Solana, Movement, and EigenLayer. I enjoy solving complex, real-world problems with clean architecture, high performance, and secure design.

I’ve built multiple on-chain applications, integrating smart contracts with modern frontend frameworks, AI agents, and decentralized infrastructure. I also work extensively with tools like AWS, EKS, Redis, Grafana, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines to ship production-ready systems.

One of my most impactful blockchain projects is ReTix, selected for the Base Fellowship.

ReTix solves fraud in ticket reselling using zkTLS proofs generated via Reclaim. The system verifies that:
	•	A seller actually owns the legitimate ticket
	•	The correct ticket is delivered to the buyer
	•	Fraud attempts (wrong ticket, duplicate ticket, etc.) are blocked cryptographically

At CoinSwitch, I helped design and build a high-performance API trading platform used by algo traders and institutions. I worked on:
	•	Low-latency order execution APIs
	•	Real-time WebSocket market data streaming
	•	Secure HMAC-signed endpoints and rate limiting
	•	A scalable Golang microservice architecture running on AWS EKS

This platform enabled programmatic trading at scale and significantly improved reliability and throughput for high-volume users.
