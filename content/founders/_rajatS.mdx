## About

I’m a developer who loves building things that actually solve problems. I enjoy taking ideas from scratch and turning them into something real, especially when it involves backend systems, Web3, and decentralized tech.
One of my main projects is TempFileStorage, a decentralized file sharing platform where users can upload files for a limited time and pay using a custom version of the X402 crypto payment flow. It supports dynamic pricing, access based on duration, late payments, and secure file retrieval using signatures instead of upfront transfers.
I’m also working on a smart ride sharing platform designed for students. It matches people based on their schedules and location patterns so they can share rides more efficiently and naturally.
What drives me is curiosity. I like understanding how things work behind the scenes and I get excited about building something useful from the ground up. I am always exploring new tools, new ideas, and ways to learn by doing.
