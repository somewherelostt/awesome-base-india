## About

Hii, I am Abhishek Bhagat
💫 I'm a passionate Blockchain Developer and Researcher. I'm also a skilled Web Developer, combining the power of blockchain technology with web applications to create innovative and secure solutions.

🌐 I believe in the potential of blockchain to revolutionize industries by providing transparency, security, and decentralization. My journey in this field has led me to explore various aspects of blockchain, including smart contract development, consensus algorithms, and decentralized applications (DApps).

🔐 One of my core interests lies in the fascinating world of public key cryptography, particularly focusing on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). I'm captivated by the mathematical elegance and security that ECC brings to the table, and I'm constantly exploring ways to integrate this technology into the blockchain systems I develop.

📚 My research interests extend to the tokenization of assets, from real estate to digital collectibles as well as in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). I'm dedicated to exploring the ways blockchain can democratize access to assets and transform traditional financial systems.
