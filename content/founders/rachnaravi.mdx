## About

I'm an illustrator and multi faceted designer dabbling in all things visual and blockchain related. Previously participated as designer with my respective teams in Onchain Summer Buildathon and Based India hackathons. We won the latter! Also a winner of Octant's Design for Ethereum where my logo for HEVM was selected by the team.
