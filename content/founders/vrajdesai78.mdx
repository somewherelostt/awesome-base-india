## About

I am currently working as DevRel Engineer [@Huddle01](https://huddle01.com). I have been participating in hackathons in from past 2 years and won over 15+ Hackathons out of which 10+ are web3 hackathons. I am a seasoned hacker who loves to convert ideas into code, I am building projects on web3 from more than a year. I know smart contract development using solidity and Next JS for frontend as well as backend.
