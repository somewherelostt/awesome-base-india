## About

👋 Hey, I'm Ayush — founder of Spryntworks. I wrote my first line of code at 8, built my first web app before high school, and haven't stopped since.

Over the years, I've shipped 50+ products across web, mobile, AI, and Web3 — and earned over $135K in hackathon wins by turning raw ideas into working products, fast.
