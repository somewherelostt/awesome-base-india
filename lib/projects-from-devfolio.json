    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI've seen brilliant ideas die due to lack of resources. Base India offers a chance to change that. I'm here because I believe in the power of our communities to solve their own problems. BasedCoffee is my attempt to connect local innovators with supporters who understand their challenges. It's not just about funding; it's about empowering our neighborhoods to create the change they need.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI'm addressing the critical funding gap faced by small-time entrepreneurs and local innovators across India. In many communities, brilliant ideas for solving local problems are gathering dust because traditional funding sources aren't accessible. Banks often overlook small ventures, and VCs chase only the next unicorn. I've seen friends with solid business plans wait for years, scraping together savings, just to get their ideas off the ground. This wait not only kills dreams but also holds back entire communities from progress. Additionally, there's a disconnect between these grassroots problem-solvers and community support. Existing platforms don't cater well to local initiatives, making it hard for neighborhoods to back projects that could directly improve their lives.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nBasedCoffee tackles the funding gap for small-time entrepreneurs and local innovators in several ways:\n\n1. Accessible Pitching: The platform uses 60-second video pitches, allowing entrepreneurs to showcase their ideas quickly and engagingly. This format levels the playing field, making it possible for anyone with a smartphone to present their project, regardless of their background or writing skills.\n\n2. Rapid Funding Cycles: Unlike traditional funding methods that can take months or years, BasedCoffee allows projects to start receiving funds as soon as they're posted. This speed can be crucial for time-sensitive local initiatives or entrepreneurs who can't afford long waiting periods.\n\n3. Transparent Transactions: Built on smart contracts, every transaction on BasedCoffee is transparent and traceable. This builds trust between creators and backers, crucial in small communities where reputation matters.\n\n4. Micro-investments: The platform allows for small contributions, enabling more community members to participate in funding. This democratizes the investment process, allowing projects to gather support from a broader base rather than relying on a few large investors.\n\nWhile not included in this version, we plan to implement a robust verification system in the future to further enhance trust and credibility on the platform.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Smart Contract Architecture: The need for each creator to have a separate smart contract while maintaining scalability posed a significant challenge. I solved this by implementing a factory contract pattern. This main contract dynamically deploys individual campaign contracts, allowing for flexibility to adapt to different user needs while ensuring scalability as the platform grows.\n\n2. Video Storage and Performance: Handling video content efficiently was crucial for the platform's performance. Videos can be bulky and potentially slow down the site. To address this, I implemented a blob storage solution. This approach allows for faster video loading and streaming, significantly improving the user experience without compromising on the quality of video pitches.\n\n3. Responsive and Intuitive UI Design: Creating a mobile-first UI that's both intuitive and easy to use, while ensuring it works seamlessly on desktop as well, was a complex task. I focused on responsive design principles, using flexible layouts and breakpoints to ensure the interface adapts smoothly across different screen sizes. This required careful consideration of touch interfaces for mobile users while maintaining full functionality for desktop users.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWhile BasedCoffee was started as a Farcaster frame, for the Buildathon, I revamped it as a mobile-first-video focussed crowdfunding platform.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are participating in Based India because of our deep-rooted connection to the Indian artistic community and a passionate desire to empower independent artists in the region. Growing up in Bangalore, we immersed ourselves in the local music and art scenes, forging friendships with artists and witnessing firsthand the struggles they face. These artists have profoundly influenced our lives, and we feel a strong responsibility to give back to the community that has given us so much joy and inspiration.\n\nWe are on a mission to create a platform that genuinely supports artists and fans alike. CultureCo is not just a startup; it's a love letter to the artists who have shaped our experiences, and a commitment to nurturing the cultural landscape of India. Participating in Based India offers an opportunity to leverage cutting-edge technology to address the unique challenges faced by artists and fans in our region.\n\nBase provides the ideal foundation to build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that brings the benefits of blockchain technology to the masses without the complexities typically associated with it. By integrating with Base, we aim to create a seamless experience that can attract a large number of users in India, fostering a vibrant community where artists can thrive and fans can engage more meaningfully, and Indian art can find its forever home onchain.\n\nOur participation aligns with our mission to uplift the local artistic community, bridge gaps between artists and fans, and utilize innovative solutions to solve real-world problems. We believe our product directly solves the problems of local Indian artists, and have extensively worked with them to validate it. We hope to create a lasting impact on the cultural fabric of our region and contribute to the growth of the creative economy.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on several critical challenges faced by the artistic community in India:\n\n1. Lack of Sustainable Monetization for Artists: Independent artists struggle to earn a stable income due to fragmented platforms, middlemen, and the devaluation of art in the digital age. They own their distribution yet do not own their deals, and likes and follows rarely translate into meaningful financial support, making it difficult for artists to sustain their livelihoods.\n\n2. Weak Artist-Fan Connections: Current platforms do not facilitate deep, meaningful relationships between artists and their fans. True fans often go unrecognized and unrewarded, despite their loyalty and early support, leading to a disconnect that hampers community growth.\n\n3. Unfair Access to Events and Content: Scalpers and inefficient ticketing systems prevent genuine fans from accessing events, and artists miss out on connecting with their core audience. This undermines the value of the fan, the outcome of the live experience, and the potential revenue for artists.\n\n4. Complexity of Blockchain Technology: While blockchain offers solutions like secure transactions and authentic ownership, its complexity becomes an obstacle widespread adoption among everyday users and artists who might benefit from its advantages, and begs to be abstracted away\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nCultureCo is a creator commerce platform designed to empower independent artists and enrich the artist-fan relationship, and immortalized by tokenizing these transactions onchain.\n\nProject Description:\n- Unified Platform: CultureCo offers a single space where artists can sell memberships, digital and physical art, merchandise, and event tickets. This eliminates intermediaries, allowing artists to retain more earnings and manage their businesses efficiently.\n- Fan Engagement and Recognition: Features like badges, achievements, and exclusive content recognize and reward true fans. This strengthens the artist-fan bond and fosters a loyal community where fans feel valued and artists build lasting relationships.\n- Simplified Blockchain Integration: By integrating with Base, we record transactions on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and secure ownership of digital assets without burdening users with technical complexities. Blockchain interactions are abstracted, providing a seamless on-chain experience for users.\n- Fair Access to Events: We create fair ticketing systems that prioritize genuine fans, reducing scalping and ensuring artists connect with their core audience. This enhances live experiences and maximizes revenue for artists.\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Empowering Artists: Artists gain financial independence and can focus on their craft with a sustainable income and supportive community, leading to the legitimization of the artist occupation in India (via their fans).\n- Enriching Cultural Landscape: By supporting artists, we contribute to the growth and diversity of India's cultural scene, making art more accessible and valued, and becoming a cultural exporter of Indian art. Fans actively participate in nurturing this culture, and also owning a piece of it.\n- Mass Adoption of Blockchain: Simplifying blockchain integration through Base encourages widespread adoption of blockchain technology in India, bringing users onchain by focusing on the culture.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nNon-technical challenges:\n- Productizing the Commerce Stack: Understanding all the ways artists had to sell was difficult. We did user interviews with 34 artists to find a common set of ways creator often sell to their fans and transformed that into a simplified sell form.\n- Onboarding artists via demos: The early alpha product was still rough and some initial creators were disappointed by the buggy experience of onboarding. So we built demo creator pages that allowed us to build out the creators pages for them, and they could approve and claim their profiles with a unique creator code that we generated in the backend for them, smoothening out their onbaording process, and wowing them off the bat. We selectively onboarded 10 Indian artists for alpha testing with real art, merch, and events for sale.\n\nTechnical challenges:\n- Payment options: Our artists insisted that we integrate all forms of payment, and not just crypto. So based on user interviews, we integrated Razorpay (INR via UPI), Stripe (USD via Credit/Debit), and CopperX (USDC via Base) for all payment options.\n- Alpha testing: We ran an alpha test with 50+ users and they registered 14 bugs at 6 different interaction points that we fixed and deployed in under 48 hours, and drastically improved our user experience. We still have 4 major bugs that we will fix after hackathon that would require platform rearchitecture efforts.\n- Minting onchain: The challenge of abstracting away all onchain interactions proved to be tricky since there are multiple steps involved. We started with abstracting away wallets, by creating wallets ourselves for users in the backend. We abstracted the minting process by building a factory smart contract that deployed a unique 1155 smart contract per creator (co-owned by us) that read the transactions on our database and batchminted all new tokens and airdropped them to wallets of new collectors, resulting in a proper onchain token system at no cost to the end user.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nBefore the hackathon, we only had a simple Google Auth with the card for digital art.\n\nHackathon features built in the last 3 weeks:\n- Creator profile (Feed, Shop, Events)\n- Sell form (Digital Collectibles, Physical Sales, Tickets)\n- Demo Creator and Creator Profile Claim flow\n- Tribe memberships and discounts\n- Payments via Razorpay, Stripe, CopperX\n- Explore feed to explore alpha creators and randomized art\n- User Profile with collectibles view\n- Ticketing flow with early fan and tribe presales\n- Badges & Achievements system\n- Collaboration posts with other artists\n- Music player for Digital Music collectibles\n- Auto wallet creations\n- Factory Smart Contracts for 1155 token airdrops\n- Landing Page (3 iterations)\n- Founder's Letters\n- CultureCo GitBook\n- Alpha Testing"

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe\u2019re participating in Based India because we want to make going onchain easier and more approachable for everyone. With Castmoney, we aim to create a platform where users can bring their friends onchain in a way that feels simple, social, and not intimidating.\n\nIn India, investment decisions are often influenced by social networks, whether it\u2019s family gatherings or friend groups discussing market trends. We want to build on this cultural insight by making it easier for people to explore DeFi with their social circles. Imagine a scenario where even kitty party aunties are excitedly sharing which memecoins Sharma ji's son just bought, lol. Castmoney aims to leverage this inherent social behavior and make investing in DeFi a shared, trusted experience.\n\nOver the last few years, our team has actively contributed to the Ethereum ecosystem in India. We\u2019ve been advocates for the community constantly pushing to get more builders involved onchain. Through onboarding our IRL friends into crypto, we\u2019ve seen firsthand what confuses or overwhelms them. Castmoney is our solution to address these challenges and make the onboarding experience smoother for newcomers.\n\nOur team is born and raised in India and we\u2019ve been deeply involved in growing the Ethereum India ecosystem. Participating in Based India is a way for us to give back to the region and help drive the adoption of base and ethereum further within our social circles through Castmoney.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nDeFi today is like the wild west\u2014exciting, but risky. Casual users often get burned because there\u2019s too much activity happening onchain and it\u2019s hard to make sense of it all. The challenges we\u2019re focusing on with Castmoney include:\n\n**PvP nature**: The ecosystem is intimidating, competitive, and often unwelcoming to newcomers.\n**Too much noise, too little signal**: It\u2019s tough for users to navigate and filter out useful information from the sea of transactions and contextless hex addresses.\n**Lack of guardrails for new users**: While seasoned DeFi users have all the tools they need, newcomers are left without any protection or guidance, often falling victim to bad actors and losing money early on.\n\nFrom our experience onboarding friends into crypto, we\u2019ve seen how intimidating this space can be. Once they lose money, they hesitate to return. Castmoney makes DeFi more accessible by integrating a social layer, letting users explore and engage with friends, making it a safer, more enjoyable experience.\n\n**Social equals fun.** We\u2019ve noticed that being onchain becomes more engaging when you do it with friends. Once we onboarded our friends, we found ourselves becoming much more active onchain. The stickiness of any behavior increases dramatically when it\u2019s done socially. Castmoney is DeFi made social, making it both fun and trustworthy.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nWe aim to make DeFi less intimidating and more trustworthy by leveraging an often-overlooked insight: \n\n**Your social connections influence what you buy and where you buy it from.**\n**Your network unlocks economic opportunities**: Social connections often provide early access to opportunities.\n**Trust built through networks**: Commerce and interaction are smoother when there\u2019s trust fostered through known connections.\n\nWith Castmoney, users can discover onchain opportunities: swaps, positions, staking, bets, etc that your Farcaster network has already interacted with. Instead of relying on unverified information from influencers or KOLs on Twitter or Telegram groups, Castmoney enables discovery based on actual onchain actions from people in your social graph.\n\nWhile the current v0.1 focuses on swaps, we\u2019re planning to expand into more onchain activities: NFT mints, Polymarket bets, social vaults, DeFi positions, staking, lending/borrowing opportunities, and more \u2014 making Castmoney a one-stop platform for users to explore DeFi through the lens of their social connections.\n\nOur thesis is that interacting with DeFi protocols will become far less intimidating when social proof is involved. When I onboard a friend to Castmoney, they can see what protocols I\u2019ve interacted with and what other friends on Farcaster are doing. This social validation lowers the trust barrier significantly.\n\nEssentially, we\u2019re inheriting trust from a user\u2019s Farcaster social graph. If user A trusts user B on Farcaster, it\u2019s natural for A to trust B\u2019s onchain activity. With Castmoney, we are focused on delivering the most intuitive UI, powered by social graph insights, to make it easy for casual users to discover and engage with DeFi.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. One of our biggest hurdles was collecting and processing transaction data across Base and Ethereum networks. The complexity of handling such large volumes of data and mapping it to the Farcaster social graph presented several technical obstacles.\n2. Building the real-time feed itself was a challenge, especially with the need for low latency and data consistency. Ensuring the feed updates smoothly while reflecting onchain activities accurately was crucial.\n3. We addressed these challenges by optimizing our backend, streamlining the data aggregation process, and refining how we track and display onchain activity in real-time.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n1. We started working on Castmoney long before the Buildathon and even built an earlier version of the product. However, we encountered technical challenges in scaling that version to handle real-time data and user discovery.\n2. During the Buildathon, we shifted our focus entirely toward developing the discovery engine, the feed, which helps users find real-time onchain opportunities based on the Farcaster social graph.\n3. The feed is now the core feature for this submission, reflecting our commitment to real-time discovery and user engagement.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nBecause we truly believe Base's vision of everyone being a builder and wanted to build for a problem we believe in and relate to. Our core motivation, as a non-technical team that focuses on web3 marketing, was to solve a problem we face ourselves and eat our own dogfood when it comes to building products, and then marketing them.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on the challenge of making web3 gaming accessilbe and fun for gamers across India. India has a massive gaming base and thus we want to incentivise this base to come onchain and have more fun onchain. We are focusing on 3 aspects in particular:\n(i) Discoverability - as gamers ourselves, we had a tough time finding / knowing about any web3 games so wanted to create a 1-stop-shop for web3 game discoverability i.e. those games built on Base. \n\n(ii) Onboarding & Customisability - even after finding web3 games, onboarding players becomes the next challenges for games. Often times onboarding flows are super-complex. So we decided to abstract the complexity and create custom CTAs for each game to allow player's to immediately taste and experience the look and feel of the game. \n\nFor e.g. for a trading card game, the CTA would be \"claim your 1st pack now\" - allowing players to mint a card pack and immediately get a flavour of the game, thereby reducing their friction to proceed further with playing the game. \n\n(iii) Betting & Prediction Markets for Gaming Tournaments - lastly, we wanted to include web3 native features enabling new experiences that feel web2 and tap into existing gamer behaviour of being naturally speculative and degen. Gamers love playing together, watching their favourite streamers together and betting together. \n\nSo why not tap into this existing behaviour and allow them to bet on gaming tournaments and outcomes? \n\nThus our v1 allows any game to host a tournaments and then for gamers to bet on which participants of the gaming tournament they think will win. They deposit USDC in a pool and then once the tournament is over, the losers loose their bet and winners take it all pro rata. \n\nOur aim is to expand beyond just gaming tournaments and players to any gaming events, outcomes and basically allow anyone to create gaming related betting / prediction pools permissionlessly.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission makes web3 games on Base\n- Discoverable\n- Playable\n- Competable (tournament creation)\n- Betable\n\nWe've designed our features keeping the marketing funnel in mind (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action) to make it naturally appealing and gradually engaging. \n\nThis design and approach will help the massive web2 gaming community in India to come onchain and have fun onchain. They will know where to find games, where to get started and also participate in a web3 native betting experience that is focused on web2 consumer behaviour and enjoy the process. \n\nWe're making web3 gaming fun and accessible again for the huge gaming community in India.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Backend integration challenge:\n\n- We tackled this by employing an iterative development approach, where we continuously refined the backend systems through trial and error. Regular testing cycles helped identify integration issues early, allowing us to make adjustments and optimize the interaction between different components of the platform.\n\n2. Smart contract security \n- To ensure the security of the smart contracts governing our tournaments and betting system, we reviewed and incorporated best practices from already audited smart contracts. This helped us safeguard against potential exploits and vulnerabilities, minimizing the risk of financial loss. \n\n3. Designing and implementing the logic for betting, bet resolution, and payouts, while maintaining fairness and transparency.\nHere are the various aspects we finally covered and fixed:\n-  Automatic Fund Handling: When players place bets, their funds are automatically locked into the contract, signifying that they are willing to lose the amount. No further user interaction is needed once a bet is placed.\n\n - Bet Resolution: The contract logic dictates that once the tournament owner ends the tournament, the funds are distributed based on predefined rules among the winning participants. The process is entirely handled on-chain, removing any possibility for manual interference.\n\n - Payout Mechanism: The contract ensures that the payout is fair and distributed proportionally to the winning participants. Every transaction is recorded and visible on-chain, allowing anyone to audit the flow of funds and verify fairness.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nOur project was built during this hackathon so we added all the features this time itself.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI\u2019m participating in Based India because, as an Indian, I see a significant opportunity to make blockchain more accessible to everyone. One major barrier to entry is the need for Ether to pay for gas fees, which often deters new users from engaging with blockchain technology. By helping to facilitate easier onboarding, we can empower more people to explore and utilize blockchain applications.\n\nAdditionally, for advertisers, lowering transaction costs will make it cheaper to display ads, fostering a more vibrant ecosystem. This dual approach not only enhances user experience but also encourages more businesses to participate, driving growth and innovation within the Indian blockchain community. We are proud to represent BlocSoc IITR, a highly reputed club, in this mission to transform the blockchain landscape in India.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nHigh Gas Fees: One of the most significant barriers for new users entering the blockchain space is the high cost of gas fees. By finding ways to subsidize or eliminate these costs, we can make it easier for individuals to engage with blockchain applications.\n\nAccessibility and Onboarding: Ensuring that the onboarding process is straightforward and user-friendly is crucial. I\u2019m working on solutions that simplify account creation, transaction processes, and general interaction with blockchain platforms.\n\nAdvertiser Engagement: For advertisers, high transaction costs can limit their ability to effectively utilize blockchain for ad placements. I\u2019m focused on creating a more cost-effective environment that attracts advertisers and enhances their return on investment.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nGas Fee Solutions: By introducing a system that pays users' gas fees in exchange for watching ads, we directly tackle the issue of high transaction costs. This not only lowers the barrier to entry for new users but also incentivizes their participation in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nStreamlined Onboarding: Our submission includes user-friendly onboarding processes that simplify account creation and transactions. By ensuring that new users can easily navigate the platform, we enhance accessibility and encourage engagement.\n\nBuilding an SDK: We plan on building an SDK that can be easily integrated by other blockchain applications, allowing them to onboard more users effortlessly. This will expand our reach and create a network of apps benefiting from our gas fee solution.\n\nCost-Effective Advertising: By lowering transaction costs for advertisers through our platform, we create an attractive environment for ad placements. This benefits both advertisers and users, as more businesses will be willing to invest in blockchain advertising, ultimately increasing opportunities for engagement.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIncorporating Account Abstraction: One of the major challenges we faced was the difficulty of incorporating account abstraction into our system. This concept is complex and required us to rethink our architecture to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\nTranslation to JavaScript: To effectively integrate our backend functionalities with the frontend, we utilized Foundry for development. This necessitated translating our entire script into JavaScript, which was a time-consuming process. Ensuring that the translation maintained the original logic and performance was critical.\n\nAd Generation Logic: Another challenge was determining the logic for generating and displaying ads. We had to develop a robust algorithm that considers user preferences, engagement levels, and advertiser requirements to ensure relevant ads are shown while maximizing user engagement.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nBase is building with a great vigor towards consumer apps. Basenames is one such great app with the portfolio and the profile page! We would love to see more accessibility in managing basenames.\nThe motivation extends to an audience larger than India here and the premise is to allow a better user experience while creating BaseName profiles and buying BaseNames!\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nENS has done a wonderful job by expanding to Base. And with the 100+ L2s we live with, you may forget where your ETH is lying to buy that lucrative Basename. \n\nTrying to get funds in the right place is a HUUUGEE task. And did we forget bootstrapping gas on Base?\n\nWell. That's what SuperBaseNames solves!\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nSuperBaseNames provides you with the comfort to buy basenames with any tokens on any chain! \n\nWe provide an interface where users can forget about bridging their ETH and just focus on which Basenames they want to HODL.\n\nWe use the Cross-chain Intents Framework built by Router Protocol to enable the entire flow. Users can bridge their funds and buy the domain in a single interaction! We can thus enable chain abstracted experiences for the users.\n\nA brief walkthrough of how SuperBaseNames work:\n1. Users find their desired BaseName, and select the asset they want to pay.\n2. The quote API creates an optimal quote/route for swapping user's paid asset and ETH on Base.\n3. This same quote includes the calldata to buy the ENS for the user.\n4. Whenever the final transaction occurs on Base, the ENS is bought for the user. \n5. Excess ETH funds remaining from buying the ENS are returned to the user.\n6. Using the excess ETH, users can perform a second step to set the ENS as their primary name.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n(Back pain.)\n\nFiguring out how the basenames contracts work took a while without the docs for L2 specific actions. We used Tenderly and the ENS Github repo to figure out how we can buy names from a contract adapter.\n\nAnother huge blocker was to figure out reverse quotes for the bridging requests. The support to request for quotes with destination token amount is extremely sparse. We've created a workaround for that during this hack which needs a little bit of extra slippage. Though this extra amount is always returned to the user as ETH on Base. And this step also helps to bootstrap some gas for the second step of setting the name as a primary name for the address.\n\nSetting reverse configuration for some different address is not possible. And this really took a bunch of our time, trying to hack around the contracts and testing the deployments. As a final solution, now we require users to do another transaction to set a BaseName as their primary one.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe intents framework is built by Router Protocol. SuperBaseNames is an adapter that fits into this ecosystem.\nThe only work carried forward from Router Protocol is the open source BatchTransaction handler contracts and open source API. \n**All Basename related developments are recent and no older than 10th October 2024.**\n\nWe've worked on the following tasks to create SuperBaseNames:\n- Created the SuperBaseNames adapter contracts. Testing of the adapter contracts.\n- Built quote engine for the basenames adapter.\n- Built domain search interface.\n- Deployment of separate BatchTransaction contracts.\n- Built APIs to query domain availability, suggestions and their prices.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nBecause base is for everyone so it better get to everyone and solve real consumer problems. I'm participating in Based India because I'm from India and I've seen so many education gaps and how schools are so linear and never upgrade to what actually is needed ahead. Base\u2019s mission is to increase innovation, creativity, and freedom and that's what my vision is towards building products that help achieve the goal and increase adoption.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThere's a curiousity mindset of people in India but many are lost because they're unable to find the right path for them to grow and I feel onchain economy can open so many doors for them so it's important for them to understand how this works. We're building tools that provide easier, simpler and gamified access to the onchain economy and unlocking the access to social and educational resources making them feel connected with the people like them\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nBasics is a gamified learn to earn platform on Base that addresses onchain education challenges through:\n\nInteractive Learning: Users explore \"surf spots\" (modules) with real onchain interactions, not just text-based learning.\nReward System: Learners earn SHELLS tokens for completing activities, creating immediate value and motivation.\nGamification: Digital Surfboards track progress and unlock rewards, fostering a \"just one more wave\" engagement.\nEcosystem Integration: SHELLS can be used within the Base ecosystem, bridging learning with real-world application.\nCommunity Features: Marketplace, leaderboards, and shareable profiles create a social learning environment.\nEcosystem Discovery: Interactive map helps users navigate and utilize various products on Base.\n\nThe potential impact would be increased engagement and retention in the onchain economy and empowerment of individuals, especially in emerging markets, with new economic opportunities\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges I ran into:\n1. Figured out my way through building on Coinbase Developer Platform Paymaster and Smart wallets integration with a Solidity contract deployed on Base. There were some technical errors I faced using different providers in Privy but Privy community help team is so amazing and helpful\n2. Figuring out the content structure and design. This took a lot of thinking and brainstorming\n3. Figuring out the new features and making things even more seamless for users to navigate\n4. The gamification part, actually thinking on the theme, the shells, surfboards, knowledge score and how they all connect\n5. User acquisition - made some plans for it\n\n## Additional Features\n\nYes, Basics started like more than a month ago and it took a lot of time to think on things that we wanna do.\nDuring the Buildathon, we enhanced Basics with the following new features and thought process:\n1. Previously it was like just another learn to earn platform that makes you points and earns you nft badges after completion but you really get nothing out of it. The new vision was to gamify it so well that it makes it fun to be here so we discovered a concept of Surfboards which are more than just collectibles; they\u2019re tools that track your learning activities and let you earn tokens and rewards based on your levels.\n2. Surfboards types, levels, utilties and Shells Multipliers\n3. New content structure and design\n4. Integration with the solidity smart contract on Base to mint Surfboards seamlessly with coinbase smart wallets",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe've had a 'red pill' moment with India's excess consumerism trends seeing the amount of wastage in food and other retail by an average urban Indian. By 2030 half of India's population will be living in cities which means with more disposable income, this problem will only worsen with time. Now more than ever, there is a need for businesses to leverage open data protocols, bring their data and insights together and solve for the climate crisis. This is a hard problem to solve and consumer behaviour needs change. Base offers us the perfect opportunity to productise a scalable, high-volume transaction solution and offers us an explosive, high-agency community of builders and supporters in building a disruptive business for the modern world\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focussed on 3 major challenges. \n\nThe first challenge - Sustainability initiatives today are fragmented because supply chains are fragmented.  86% of all company emissions are Scope 3 (air water and land emissions that are emitted upstream suppliers and downstream, outside the direct control of a large business). Vendor environment data creation and sharing is a challenge and finding truly green raw materials and green vendors is guesswork. \n\nThe second challenge - greenwashing has eroded a consumer's trust in sustainability claims. According to a retail report by IBM published in 2020, 79% of Indian consumers predicate their buying decisions based on sustainability. And, 75% of Consumers do not trust the accuracy on food labels (certification standards, conformity in the supply chain, etc.). \n\nThe third - Climate policies are catching up with Climate change and the market is not ready for it. New green regulations trends are at an all-time high. And policies such as the EU Deforestation Regulation and EU CBAM will demand environmental and traceable disclosures on all exports which Indian businesses are at all equipped to support. According to the Centre for Science and Environment, it is estimated that this can potentially dent India's GDP by 0.05% due to non-compliance.\n\nLastly, voluntary carbon credit markets today are ridden with dodgy environmental science, and double counting where carbon offsets help both customers and are sold off as carbon credits. Even then there are no ways yet to verify whether or not the offsets may have been sold to multiple stakeholders. This is a 'hidden' greenwashing market, waiting to be called out in the next few years which overall - just will not make enough of a dent toward climate change.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThis project operates between 3 explosive markets - web3, climate action and consumerism. Disruption at the centre of these 3 markets, requires investor, business and consumer buy-ins. Our submission is meant to prove that this solution is technologically feasible and that it is the right use case for decentralized platforms such as Base that offer high-throughput and low transaction fees. \n\nThis product has the potential to incentive buyers, sellers, consumers and recyclers towards circularity. \n1. It enables consumers to combat greenwashing claims with product traceability. It can also equip them to handle product end-of-life via access to recyclers as well as provide incentives to close loops towards circularity. \n2. It can help green brands verifiably unlock access to green capital by creating assets out of their carbon mitigation efforts as a result of quantifiable green practices. Tokens are minted at the time a green brand gets onboarded and commoditises its 'improved performance' compared to an average manufacturer or a government-set target for their ecological footprint. The greener the brand, the more tokens minted which then gets distributed as real world transactions take place between retailers, consumers and recyclers.\n3. It helps wholesalers, retailers and exporters discover green brands and ethically meet their regulatory obligations by reducing their Scope 3 emissions as result of their engagement with green brands.\n4. Overall, it intends to build a movement towards carbon insets over carbon offsets. Where a business or even a consumer put their money where they mouth is. They reward their own value chain and earn a significant net uptick to bottom lines in return. Everybody wins on Lumen!\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nPutting together this entire flow was a massive challenge in the limited time, as this is a complex implementation and we wanted to communicate the essence in the limited time we had. This meant cutting out large parts of the idea and reducing it to a barebones MVP that hopefully messages the essence while showcasing its usability on base.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nNA. We literally went from ideating to MVP during this buildathon. The community in India is mad helpful and this was insanely fun! We've all learnt a lot doing this and hope to continue building this out.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI like to build onchain apps, and there's lots of new stuff happening with decentralized apps. Base is great because they give developers what we need - like smart wallets and ways to pay for user transactions. Plus, Base has a lot of TVL, which means more users and liquidity. It's the perfect place to build my project. That's why I'm excited to join this hackathon and show what I can make on Base.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWith our project on Base, we're tackling some key challenges for memecoin investors:\n\n- Making it simpler to buy different memecoins on Base. Right now, it's tricky for people to invest in multiple coins easily.\n- Cutting down on gas fees. We're using Base to help users trade without paying extra, which is great for smaller investors.\n- Keeping users in the know. We're providing easy access to market info and trends about Base memecoins to help people make smarter choices.\n- Simplifying the investment process. Our goal is to help folks manage their Base memecoin portfolios without needing to be tech wizards.\n- Giving more control to users. We're working on ways for people to easily adjust their investments based on what's happening in the Base memecoin market.\n\nBy building on Base, we're aiming to make memecoin investing on this chain easier, cheaper, and more user-friendly for everyone in our community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project, DefiLens Memecoin Rebalancer, helps solve problems for memecoin investors on Base. Here's what it does:\n\n- Easy buying: Users can buy many different Base memecoins at once, all in one click. This saves time and makes investing simpler.\n- No extra fees: We cover the gas fees, so users can trade without worrying about extra costs. This is really helpful for small investors.\n- Market info: We give users up-to-date info about Base memecoins. This helps them make smarter choices about what to buy or sell.\n- Simple portfolio management: Users can easily see and manage all their Base memecoins in one place. It's like having a control panel for your investments.\n- Filtering options: People can sort memecoins by things like market cap or trading volume. This helps them find the coins they're most interested in.\n\nThe impact could be big. We think this tool will make it easier for more people to get into memecoin investing on Base. It could bring new users to the Base network and help grow the whole ecosystem. By making investing easier and cheaper, we hope to see more activity and growth in the Base memecoin market.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhen we started, it was hard to figure out what to build. After talking to people and going to ETHSingapore, I learned that many users like investing in memecoins. So we decided to focus on that.\nOur biggest challenges were:\n\n- Supporting all memecoins, even new ones. We worked hard and now we support all Base memecoins.\n- Making it easy for users to buy multiple memecoins at once. We tried different designs and found a good way for users to buy or rebalance many coins in one go.\n- Connecting with different exchanges. We had to integrate Uniswap, OKX, ParaSwap, 1inch, and dZap to make sure we could handle all kinds of trades.\n- Getting fast quotes when users want to buy many coins. It was tricky, but now we can quickly get quotes even when users pick 10 or more memecoins.\n- Adding more features that users asked for, like charts and market info for each coin. We also made it so users can filter coins by things like market cap or 24-hour volume.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but we're happy with what we've built. Now users can easily buy multiple memecoins without paying gas fees, and they have all the info they need to make good choices.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe started this project during the hackathon, and we've added some cool features to make memecoin trading on Base even easier:\n\n- Bookmarks: Users can now save their favorite memecoins. This makes it quick to find and trade the coins they care about most.\n- Detailed coin analysis: We added charts, market data, 24-hour price changes, market cap, and total volume for each memecoin. This helps users make better decisions.\n- Portfolio tracker: There's now a section where users can see all the memecoins they own. It shows how much their whole portfolio is worth and makes it easy to check their buying history.\n- Batch selling: If users want to sell when they're in profit, they can now sell multiple memecoins at once. This saves time and makes taking profits easier.\n\nAll these features are new and were built during the hackathon. We wanted to give users more tools to trade and manage their memecoins on Base without hassle",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nYuga's tweet - [https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1823087061357793616](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1823087061357793616) inspired us about the concept of an AI Agent wallet. We wanted to apply the concept of data collection and payment using agents to build **TagFi**, a TikTok reel-like app for data collection and rewards.\n\n### Connection to the Region\n\nWe are based out of India. The ancient roots of India take us to the story of **Mata Shabri**, who filtered out quality fruits for **Lord Rama**, and that\u2019s where we thought AI needs many modern-day Shabris to generate **classified high-quality data**.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n**Epoch 2024** research report and podcast from **Mustafa Soleman**, Microsoft AI CEO, indicated that by 2026, high-quality text data for training LLMs will be exhausted, a trend that could slow down AI progress. Human-classified data could be a great way to continue feeding in high-quality data for specific cases where synthetic data may not work.\n\nTo make this happen, we need to address two key challenges:\n\n1. \u2705 **Verified humans** to avoid toxicity  \n2. \ud83c\udf0d **Solving this at scale**\n\nAnd that\u2019s where **TagFi** comes into the picture!\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nWe address the above two challenges in the following ways:\n\n1) **Verify users and check eligibility against user reputation**: From basic user verification systems to resist bots and bring unique users, to verifying users for their reputation in specific skills that qualify them to input data. For example, user-generated content (UGC) across different focus areas such as specific skills like medical surgery, experience like combat, and domain knowledge in wildlife.\n\n2) **Solving at scale**: There are already several projects enabling the data economy that could address similar challenges, but we feel adding social engagement with a TikTok or Instagram-like reel-making, gamified experience with filters and rewards could bring larger user bases to generate data at volume across categories.\n\n\ud83d\udd16 **Project TagFi**:  \nInstagram / TikTok reel-like verified user input collection to drive the next generation of AI model training.  \n**Personas include**:  \n- Data consumer (AI companies)  \n- Data classifier and content creator  \n\n**Key Modules**:  \n- User verification leveraging **Privado iD**  \n- AI agent-based rewards using **Coinbase SDK**  \n- Marketplace for data consumers to set requests  \n- User can download the app on ios and android\n\n\ud83e\uddbe **User flows** \n- **Simple classification flow**:  \n  A user undergoes verification and creates a profile on TagFi -> Accesses quests from the marketplace -> Classifies images across categories -> Gets rewarded  \n\n- **Content generation flow**:  \n  A user undergoes verification and creates a profile on TagFi -> Accesses quests from the marketplace -> Leverages several ways to add classified data to the dataset (e.g., mobile camera, filters, etc.) -> Data could be verified by other users based on data consumer rules -> Rewards will be proportionate to the user\u2019s reputation  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **TagFi Impact**:  \nAccess to verified user generated and proprietary content will enable hot licensing and acquisition target to help further development of AI\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Identification of Data Consumers**:  \nStudied and interacted with several AI data-providing projects like **Masa**, **Vana**, **Nukl**, and others to understand demand and supply gaps in data consumption and generation.\n\n**Exploring ways to solve RLFH** at scale with:  \n- **User verification**  \n- **User reputation**  \n- Establishing **review and rating** mechanisms  \n- **Proportional incentive mechanics**",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe're a team of hackathon fanatics based in India and we've faced a lot of heartbreak with Coldplay, Dua Lipa and United Way of Garba recently. \n\nNo authentication, overpriced resales, and trust loaded systems are some problems we've faced first-hand that we think Base solves very beautifully by virtue of being a trustless, cheap and user-friendly chain.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe ticket scene in India is pretty messy right now. \n\nWe've seen friends get turned away at IPL matches because they bought fake tickets. During big concerts, resale prices go through the roof - we're talking **5-10x** the original price sometimes (as happened with ColdPlay). And when someone can't make it to an event, selling their ticket **safely** is a real pain. These aren't just big city problems. Whether it's a cricket match in Mumbai or a local festival in Pune, ticket hassles are everywhere. \n\nVerifiable payments, SBTs/NFTs, smart contracts solve these issues at their very root. But crypto isn't well-interpreted in the masses and so we want to fix this without making people deal with complicated crypto stuff. We want to **abstract** away any **complexities** and benefit buyers and sellers to have a **pleasant**, **simple** and **rewarding** experience on Vox.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nVox keeps things simple.\n\nEach ticket is *unique* and *verifiable*. \nPrice caps at *2x* the original price.\n*Direct* buyer-seller deals with no sketchy middlemen.\nBuyers can make offers below the asking price, by placing *requests for bids*.\nMoney stays *safe in escrow* until everything checks out.\n\nWe've focused on making it super easy and frictionless to use - no crypto knowledge needed. Just buy, sell, and enjoy your events!\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAs much as NFT ticketing platforms are laughed upon, they solve very specific problems with **events** and **ticketing** especially around Indian regions. We do think that this problem can be tackled in a bottom-up approach, targetting regional events to get onchain.\n\nBuilding all this during Navratri was intense (shoutout to the team who coded through garba nights!), but we managed to pack in all the key features we wanted.\n\nOne big hurdle, though, was making the tech user-friendly. Most people don't care about blockchain - they just want their tickets. So we had to figure out how to use Base's strengths without scaring folks off with crypto jargon. And while we acknowledge there's scope for improvement, we believe we've done a decent job.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nVox is the lovechild of Based India alone \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe started this during the Buildathon!",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are a group of motivated blockchain enthusisasts who like to get their hands dirty working problems . We are part of BlocSoc IITR (Blockchain Society IIT Roorkee)Hearing about this great opportunity to show off our work , we decided to participate in this hackathon . This hackathon provides an excellent platform to explore new ideas, collaborate with like-minded developers, and bring llike light clients like Selene to a wider audience.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on the challenge of centralized data reliance in Web3 applications. Many current dApps depend heavily on third-party APIs . For example in Neom we have used  Alchemy , CoinGecko and Reservoir for rpc calls , which undermines the decentralized ethos of the ecosystem. We aim to remove these centralized intermediaries by integrating Selene to provide decentralized data through light client architecture.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project, Neom, is.  a multichain portfolio manager with a light cliient as its blockchain data fetcher . We tackles this issue of centralized data reliance in Web3 applications by using Selene to fetch decentralized, trustless blockchain data instead of relying on centralized RPC services. This enables us to not only get our portfolio data seamlessly in one go but also verifiable know that the data is correct and can be trusted .Selene uses a consensus layer and execution layer (consensus rpc and execution rpc respectively) to fetch data and verify the data . With verified block headers and Merkle proof validation, Neom improves data integrity and security. The solution ensures that portfolio data and other Web3 information are verifiable and untampered, creating a decentralized and reliable user experience.\nThis means that a malicious RPC cannot trick you into believing false data it can only refuse to provide you data upon which Selene will just switch the RPC.This is a huge step towards Full Decentralization as any user with low computational resources can also run Selene and trustlessly verify data for themselves .\nThis project has the potential to significantly reduce reliance on third-party APIs, empower developers to build more secure and decentralized dApps, and enhance the trustworthiness of blockchain interactions.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding a Light Client from scratch is a long and complicated process which takes time .Right now Selene is not fully functional . We are just showing a proof of concept on what would be considered the future in Blockchain . Even building a Portfolio Manager in a short time is a bit challenging , having to deal with fetching a lot of logs , api retries , getting nft prices , filtering from the nft metadata what all is important and getting token contract addresses .\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe are actively working on Selene since the start of June and we plan to ship v0.1 of Selene withing the first week of November'24 itself ! During the hackathon we worked on testing the Execution Layer verification code and integrating consensus layer and execution layer to work together . However the execution module still have some work to be done before it can be fully functional and completely integrated into Neom .\nMoreover Integrating Base Names into Neom can enhance the user experience and add new functionalities to the portfolio manager. Base Names is a decentralized naming system similar to ENS (Ethereum Name Service) but specifically designed for the Base network. Users will be able to link their wallet addresses with readable names .When fetching a user\u2019s NFT portfolio or token balances, the portfolio manager could display the Base Name instead of a cryptographic address, making it more user-friendly. contributing to the broader Base ecosystem.\nNote that in video demo we presented with base and ethereum network .",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nThe future of finance is onchain, and that\u2019s where we want to be. We are drawn to Base because of its clear, ambitious goal: to make the onchain platform as impactful as the internet itself. In many ways, the parallels are clear. Just as the internet democratized information and communication, enabling people from all corners of the globe to connect and collaborate, the onchain platform is democratizing finance. But there are still obstacles that need to be overcome\u2014scaling, usability, security\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what Base is tackling head-on.\nWhat excites me the most about Base is that it\u2019s open-source and free to use. Another reason we want to be part of Base is its emphasis on collaboration. As we have come to know, the blockchain ecosystem has always thrived when people come together to build and innovate. As a developer, I\u2019m excited by the prospect of working on a platform that is built with the long-term in mind.\n\nWe are participating in Based India because, as a team with roots in India, we see immense potential for blockchain technology to address some of the country\u2019s unique challenges. India is a land of innovation and rapidly evolving digital infrastructure, yet many people still lack access to efficient financial services. Our idea for a decentralized crowdfunding platform can empower communities by enabling them to raise funds transparently and securely. \nThis approach is crucial in India, where grassroots initiatives often face difficulties in securing funding and ensuring accountability. By giving donors a voice in how funds are spent, we will ensure that every rupee is used wisely, reducing the chances of misuse and fraud. This aligns with the values of transparency and democracy, which are essential in solving real-world problems in India, such as rural development, healthcare, and education. Through this project, we aim to contribute to India\u2019s growing blockchain ecosystem and help make financial tools more accessible to all.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nDecentralized Governance: Creating a system where donors have proportional voting rights to decide how funds are used introduces complexities in managing decentralized decision-making fairly and transparently.\n\nSmart Contract Security: Ensuring that funds are securely held by smart contracts and are only released based on voting outcomes requires building and testing robust, secure smart contract logic to prevent vulnerabilities or misuse.\n\nFair Voting Mechanism: Implementing a voting mechanism where each donor's voting power is proportional to their contribution, and ensuring that the majority decision governs the fund release process, is a key challenge.\n\nTransparency & Trust: Building trust among users by maintaining transparency in fund management and voting processes to prevent fraud or mismanagement of funds.\n\nUser-friendly Interface: Ensuring that even non-technical users can easily connect wallets, create campaigns, donate, and vote on proposals through an intuitive Next.js interface.\n\nInteroperability: Seamlessly integrating frontend technologies like Next.js, RainbowKit UI, and Wagmi with smart contract interactions, ensuring that wallet connections and voting processes work efficiently across different blockchain environments (e.g., Polygon Amoy, Base Sepolia TestNet).\n\nReal-time Voting & Fund Release: Managing real-time updates for the voting process and ensuring that funds are automatically and accurately released based on donor decisions.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission addresses the challenges of creating a decentralized crowdfunding platform by focusing on user-friendly design, transparent governance, and secure fund management. By allowing donors to have a say in how funds are used, the platform fosters trust and accountability among users. Simple templates for spending proposals and an easy-to-use voting interface ensure that everyone, regardless of technical skill, can participate in decision-making. Regular updates on fund usage and voting outcomes maintain transparency, while secure smart contracts protect the funds from misuse. This approach creates a fair and engaging environment for both project creators and donors, making the crowdfunding process more democratic and trustworthy.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\u2022 Setting up wallet connections with wagmi and RainbowKit was a new concept for us. While these tools offer excellent abstractions for handling wallet connections, as beginners, understanding how to correctly configure connectors and handle wallet interactions was overwhelming at first. Now, how did we overcome them? We studied wagmi and RainbowKit documentation, implemented basic wallet connection functionality, and gradually added custom features like handling multiple wallet types. Step-by-step, we built confidence in integrating wallets into Nebula.\n\n\u2022 Other than this, what we struggled for a while was learning to write the ignition module for our smart contract, which once we figured out, came out to be quite easy.\n\n\u2022 Fetching data from the blockchain and displaying it on the frontend was tricky. It wasn\u2019t always intuitive how to integrate blockchain events and data into a Next.js project.  By using wagmi hooks like useReadContract, we were able to listen for contract updates and display real-time data. \n\n\u2022 As beginners in Web3, the sheer volume of new concepts\u2014smart contracts, wallets, gas fees, testnets\u2014was overwhelming at times. We split up tasks and tackled them one by one, allowing each team member to focus on different aspects like contract development, frontend integration, and wallet connections. Sharing each other's updates in virtual meets definitely helped us out a lot.\n\n\u2022 The voting and proposal feature was the most challenging aspect, especially since decentralized governance models (DAO-style) were completely new to us. Although we haven't been able to implement the vote and withdraw proposal feature to our application in this version, we are looking forward to incorporating them in updates.\n\n\u2022 Making parts of it responsive has also been quite a task.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nAlthough we initialized our project before the buildathon, we have implemented most of our features during the duration including:\n\u2022 Campaign Dashboard\n\u2022 Campaign Addition\n\u2022 Withdrawing funds from a campaign\n\u2022 Funding a campaign\n\nThese are the important ones among others.",

Current wallet solutions typically require users to generate and securely store mnemonic phrases, which consist of a sequence of 12 or 24 words that serve as a recovery mechanism for their accounts. While this system effectively maintains decentralization and gives users control over their assets, it also introduces notable security risks. Users who lose or improperly store these mnemonic phrases may find themselves locked out of their accounts, permanently losing access to their funds.\n\nFurthermore, managing these sensitive recovery phrases can be cumbersome, particularly for individuals who may not be well-versed in cybersecurity practices. The requirement to memorize or securely store mnemonic phrases places the entire burden of security on the users, creating a friction point that can discourage potential participants from engaging with blockchain technology. \n\nTo overcome these challenges, blockchain solutions must evolve to provide smoother, more user-friendly experiences. This includes abstracting away complex processes and offering intuitive interfaces that simplify the onboarding journey. Additionally, integrating familiar recovery methods\u2014such as biometric authentication or social logins\u2014can help users feel more comfortable and secure while managing their blockchain accounts.\n\nUltimately, making blockchain accessible to the everyday user is essential for unlocking its transformative potential and achieving mainstream adoption across various industries. By addressing the current pain points associated with user onboarding, we can create an inclusive ecosystem that invites individuals from all backgrounds to explore and benefit from the advantages of blockchain technology.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nBaseway Wallet is dedicated to addressing the challenges of blockchain onboarding by leveraging account abstraction and passkeys. This innovative approach ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience, enabling users to set up their wallets with just a single click on their smartphones or laptops in Base chain. By eliminating the need for complex mnemonic phrases and private key management, users can effortlessly generate passkey credentials and create smart accounts, significantly simplifying the onboarding process and enhancing overall convenience. \n\nCurrent Features of Baseway Wallet\nWeb Version: The wallet is readily accessible through a web interface, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and eliminating the need for cumbersome installations.

This feature allows users to interact with a wide range of dApps without requiring additional steps or modifications from developers.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe have  faced several challenges in our development process. One significant issue is the implementation of a custom paymaster and bundler, specifically tailored from the Eth Infinitum bundler to meet our unique requirements. For our system to function optimally, we need to deploy multiple components simultaneously; however, we currently lack the hosting capacity to accomplish this. As a result, we are utilizing the StackUp bundler in the interim.\n\nWe have developed custom solutions because we have specific plans for further integrations that depend on support from external parties. Until we receive that support, we decided to proceed with our own custom implementations to advance our development efforts.\n\nAdditionally, we have integrated Baseway Wallet with Telegram Mini Apps. However, we are encountering limitations as the Android version of Telegram Mini Apps does not support passkeys at this time; it currently only supports the Telegram desktop and web versions. This restriction poses a challenge for seamless user experience across different platforms, and we are actively exploring solutions to address this issue.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe are excited to introduce additional features that enhance the functionality and user experience of Baseway Wallet.\n\nWeb Login Support\n\nBaseway Wallet now offers **web login support** that is directly integrated into the wallet, allowing users to access their accounts effortlessly through their web browsers. This feature simplifies the login process and provides a seamless experience for users who prefer to manage their wallets on larger screens.\n\nIntegration of Multiple Apps\n\nCurrently, when new users onboard to Web3, navigating through numerous decentralized applications (dApps) can be a daunting task. To address this, we are working on integrating multiple apps directly into the Baseway Wallet. This integration will enable users to access various services and functionalities within a single platform, streamlining their experience and eliminating the need to switch between different applications.\n\nSimplified Fund Transfers\n\nOne of the exciting features we are planning is a user-friendly fund transfer system that allows users to send money to other accounts using mobile numbers, similar to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) used in traditional finance. This feature will make transactions faster and more intuitive, reducing the friction often associated with sending funds in the blockchain space. By leveraging familiar methods, we aim to make blockchain transactions accessible to everyone, further enhancing the usability of Baseway Wallet.\n\nThese additional features reflect our commitment to creating a more inclusive and user-friendly experience within the blockchain ecosystem.

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nIn participating in Based India, I aim to immerse myself in the vibrant ecosystem of Web3 technology and decentralized applications. This hackathon presents an invaluable opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals, gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge tools and frameworks, and enhance my coding skills in a supportive environment. I\u2019m excited to learn from industry experts, tackle real-world challenges, and contribute to innovative solutions that could shape the future of technology. Engaging with the community and sharing knowledge will not only broaden my understanding of Web3 but also inspire me to push my creative boundaries and grow as a developer.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn the sports community, many deserving athletes face significant challenges due to corruption and unfair practices. Selection processes often lack transparency, leading to favoritism and bias that overlook talented individuals. As a result, these athletes miss opportunities to compete and represent their country, hindering their potential and aspirations. The absence of a standardized and equitable evaluation system further exacerbates this issue, leaving many without recognition for their skills and hard work.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project, SportsForces, is designed to address the challenges of corruption and unfair practices in the sports community by creating a Web3-based platform that emphasizes transparency and decentralization. By leveraging blockchain technology, we provide a secure and verifiable environment for organizing tournaments and competitions. SportsForces allows athletes to create tournaments with their peers and stake money as prizes, ensuring that all participants are treated fairly and equally. Additionally, we implement a competitive rating system similar to Codeforces, which offers a transparent metric for evaluating athletes' performance. This approach not only motivates athletes to improve their skills but also provides selectors with a clear and unbiased framework for identifying talent, ultimately fostering a fairer and more inclusive sports environment.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the main hurdles was understanding and integrating Web3 technologies, particularly with MetaMask and smart contracts. The initial setup and connection to the wallet were confusing, and I struggled with issues related to wallet addresses and transaction signing. To overcome this, I dedicated time to studying documentation and following tutorials on integrating Web3 with React applications, which helped clarify the process.\n\nCreating a user-friendly interface for the platform was another challenge. I needed to ensure that users could easily navigate between different functionalities, such as tournament creation, registration, and voting. To address this, I conducted user testing with peers, gathered feedback, and iteratively improved the UI based on their suggestions.\n\nDuring the development of SportsForces, I encountered several technical and non-technical hurdles. One significant technical challenge was integrating wallet connection functionality using viem and ethers, which required a solid understanding of Web3 principles and careful handling of asynchronous operations. I also faced issues with managing state across components efficiently, as the platform needed to maintain real-time updates for user interactions and tournament data. To overcome these challenges, I adopted a modular architecture that allowed for independent component functionality, implemented React's Context API for efficient state management, and utilized Material-UI for a responsive user interface. Additionally, I prioritized robust software and solution design by focusing on user-centric features, ensuring decentralized transactions through smart contracts, and incorporating user feedback into the design process. This approach helped create a scalable, user-friendly platform that addresses the community's needs while promoting transparency and fairness in sports.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nIn the future, SportsForces plans to implement several exciting features to further enhance the platform and its user experience. A better rating algorithm will be introduced, providing a more accurate and fair assessment of athletes' performance across various sports. This algorithm will take into account different criteria, such as the level of competition, player statistics, and historical performance, ensuring that ratings reflect true skill levels.\n\nWe also aim to expand the platform to support multiple sports, allowing users to create tournaments and competitions across various athletic disciplines. This inclusivity will cater to a wider audience and promote sportsmanship in various fields.\n\nFurthermore, the addition of coaches to the platform will create a mentorship opportunity, enabling users to receive guidance and training from experienced professionals. Coaches can provide valuable insights, personalized training plans, and strategic advice, enhancing the overall development of athletes.\n\nThese future enhancements will ensure that SportsForces not only addresses the current challenges in sports representation and selection but also fosters a thriving community focused on growth, fairness, and transparency in the world of sports.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nBlockchain and India \u2013 two of my greatest passions, and the Base India Hackathon provides the perfect opportunity to merge them. I\u2019ve always believed that blockchain technology has the power to revolutionize industries, economies, and most importantly, lives. Being born and raised in India, it\u2019s a privilege to use my skills to create something that can positively impact the local community while bringing people on-chain. This hackathon allows me to not only explore my love for blockchain but also contribute to the development of solutions tailored for the needs of the people around me. India, with its diverse and growing population, is a country full of potential but also faces many challenges. From financial inclusion to education, healthcare access, and transparent governance, there are countless areas where blockchain can drive significant improvements. For me, the idea of leveraging technology like blockchain to solve these problems is not just about innovation, but about making a tangible difference in the lives of people who need it the most.*This event also aligns with my long-term vision of promoting blockchain education and awareness.* Many people in India are still unaware of the true potential of blockchain, and through the solutions we create, we can demonstrate the value of decentralized technologies in everyday life. Blockchain has the power to provide financial sovereignty, secure identities, and create new economic opportunities for communities that have been left behind by traditional systems. I see this hackathon as an opportunity not only to build something impactful but to also play a role in bringing more people into the blockchain ecosystem.In conclusion, It\u2019s a chance to give back to the community I grew up in, to solve real problems with cutting-edge technology, and to help bring more people into the blockchain space.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I\u2019m focusing on is the lack of awareness and understanding of blockchain technology in India. While blockchain has made waves globally, it\u2019s still not a household concept here. Many people in India are unaware of its potential and benefits, and for the majority, traditional systems continue to dominate their thinking. Despite the increasing conversation around digital transformation, blockchain adoption is lagging behind. Unlike other regions where decentralized applications (dApps) are becoming more common, India is still in its early stages when it comes to exploring the full spectrum of blockchain\u2019s capabilities.The challenge is not just the technology itself, but the mindset. Many people still trust old, centralized systems, and moving away from these structures can feel daunting. People in India rely heavily on traditional financial institutions and outdated methods of governance and verification, simply because they are what they know. Blockchain, with its decentralized nature and transparent processes, could offer solutions to many inefficiencies and inequalities. Yet, there is a gap in education and accessibility that prevents the widespread adoption of this technology.I aim to address this challenge by using *Base* as a platform to educate, inform, and onboard individuals onto blockchain. The first step is creating awareness, helping people understand the potential of blockchain to solve everyday problems\u2014whether it\u2019s through providing better access to financial services, improving transparency in governance, or creating new economic opportunities. The Base platform will allow us to build solutions that can be easily understood and accessed by the local community, making blockchain not only more visible but also more approachable for everyday users.Another challenge is the lack of decentralized applications (dApps) that cater to the Indian market. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap .\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy project, *EduFi*, is designed to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in India\u2019s blockchain space: the lack of awareness and understanding of blockchain technology. You can't convince someone to use something they don't know or believe in, and this is especially true for blockchain. Many people in India are unaware of how blockchain works and its immense potential. Without proper education and awareness, the gap between traditional systems and decentralized technology will continue to widen. My platform, EduFi, is built with the goal of bridging that gap by educating, inspiring, and encouraging people to embrace blockchain technology.\nEduFi serves two key audiences: \n1. *People who know nothing about blockchain* and are curious or hesitant to explore it, and \n2. *People who have some understanding of blockchain* and want to contribute to the ecosystem.\nFor those who are new to the space, EduFi offers structured courses and educational content that simplifies blockchain concepts, making them accessible to beginners. The platform emphasizes the importance of blockchain and DeFi, explaining how these technologies can impact their lives and communities. Education is the key to unlocking blockchain\u2019s potential, and by providing step-by-step guidance, we want to make it easy for anyone, regardless of their technical background, to come on-chain.For those who are already familiar with blockchain and want to contribute, EduFi offers a space where they can create and share educational content. Educators can submit videos(Proof of Time) & in return, they can mint *tradable NFTs as options* , which can provide future financial rewards. This creates a positive feedback loop, where contributors are incentivized to share their knowledge, while also benefitting financially from their efforts.Moreover, the platform will enable users to create their own *Base Names*, providing them with a unique identity on the blockchain bring them onchain.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOn the *non-technical side*, one of the biggest hurdles was conceptualizing the idea. It took a significant amount of time to settle on a vision that would not only spread blockchain education but also encourage real engagement.I spent countless hours brainstorming how to structure the platform, what kind of courses to offer, and how to ensure they would have a positive and lasting impact. Designing the user experience\u2014figuring out how the platform should look, how users should navigate through it, and how to make it both accessible and appealing\u2014was a complex process. *technical side, I faced multiple challenges in deploying the project. Writing and deploying smart contracts was a major hurdle, especially ensuring the functionality of the **tradable NFTs*.Also,encountered issues with *backend integration* and the connection between the frontend and blockchain components. Ensuring smooth functionality, handling wallet connections, and making sure that the minting of NFTs occurred seamlessly required multiple iterations. In the end, solving these technical challenges was a long but rewarding process, bringing EduFi closer to its vision of educating and empowering people with blockchain technology.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThis project was built entirely during the hackathon, and while developing *EduFi, I also attempted to integrate language support. I specifically focused on adding **Hindi, as it's widely spoken across India, to make the platform more accessible. In the future, I aim to incorporate other regional languages like **Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam*, and more, to reach the core of India's diverse population and ensure that blockchain education is accessible to everyone, regardless of language barriers.  THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES ARE NOT FUNCTIONAL NOW",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI\u2019m excited to join Based India as a first-time hackathon participant from Kerala! My goal is to make Web3 and decentralized systems more accessible to my community. This project is my entry into the hackathon scene, and it reflects my desire to simplify blockchain tech for everyday users here in India.\n\nGrowing up in Kerala, I\u2019ve seen how technology can change lives, but I also know that its complexity can be a big hurdle. That\u2019s why I want to create something that makes Web3 concepts easier to grasp for my community.\n\nI chose Farcaster and basenames because they replace complicated wallet addresses with easy-to-remember usernames. This kind of simplification is key for adoption in India, where digital literacy is improving but tech barriers still pose challenges.\n\nThis hackathon is just the beginning for me\u2014a chance to learn, build, and maybe even make a real difference in my community. I hope to inspire others in Kerala and across India to see Web3 not as something foreign, but as a tool for local empowerment and growth.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m here for personal growth, community impact, and a vision for an inclusive digital future in India. It\u2019s about taking that first step to bring the benefits of decentralized tech to everyone, starting right here in Kerala.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn my project with Base, I'm tackling three main challenges in Kerala and across India:\n\nDigital Identity Confusion: A lot of folks find wallet addresses and cryptographic keys super complicated, which makes jumping into Web3 tough. By using Farcaster usernames and Base names, we're making digital identity way simpler and more user-friendly.\nDisconnected Conversations: Right now, Web3 chats are often stuck in their own little bubble, separate from mainstream social media. Our decentralized chat feature changes that, letting people connect using usernames they already know, which helps build community and share knowledge.\nBarriers to Financial Inclusion: Traditional financial systems can leave people out, and crypto transfers can feel intimidating. By allowing transfers through usernames, we\u2019re making it easier for everyone to get involved in decentralized finance and boosting financial literacy.\nBy tackling these challenges, we can really help more people adopt Web3 and see how useful it can be, opening the door to blockchain solutions for local issues.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy project, **Touch Base India**, tackles these challenges with three cool features:\n\n1.**Community Discovery**: Users can easily find and connect with others in their Farcaster network who have Base names. This helps build a sense of community and gets more people using Base within their existing Web3 circles.\n\n2.**Decentralized Chat**: I\u2019ve set up a user-friendly chat system that lets people communicate using Farcaster usernames or Base names. This makes it way easier to chat in Web3, especially for those who aren\u2019t familiar with wallet addresses.\n\n3.**Simplified Transfers**: Users can send funds just by using someone\u2019s Farcaster username or Base name, skipping the whole complex wallet address thing. This makes jumping into decentralized finance way less intimidating.\n\n**Potential Impact**:\n\n1.**More People Onboard**: By making it easier to find and interact with others, I\u2019m hoping to see a lot more folks adopting Base and Web3 tech in my community.\n\n2.**Boosting Digital Skills**: The simple interface will help teach users about Web3 concepts, which should improve overall digital skills.\n\n3.**Financial Inclusion**: The easy transfer feature could bring more people into decentralized finance, helping to promote financial inclusion.\n\n4.**Stronger Community**: By making connections and conversations easier, I aim to strengthen the local Web3 community in Kerala and beyond.\n\nTouch Base India is all about making Web3 interactions as simple as your favorite social media, which could really speed up blockchain adoption in my are\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### Challenges I Ran Into\n\nAs a complete newbie in programming and Web3, I faced a bunch of challenges along the way:\n\n1.**Learning Curve**: Trying to wrap my head around basic programming and the crazy world of Web3 was like trying to learn a new language while riding a roller coaster. Here\u2019s how I tackled it:\n   - Binge-watching YouTube videos and diving into documentation (thank you, internet!).\n   - Breaking the project into smaller, bite-sized tasks\u2014because, let\u2019s be real, no one can eat a whole pizza at once.\n   - Focusing on one concept at a time, like a toddler with a new toy.\n\n2.**Technical Hurdles**: Integrating all these technologies (Farcaster, Base, XMTP) felt like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the manual. Debugging in a decentralized environment? Let\u2019s just say, it was a wild ride.\n\n3.**Development Environment**: Setting up a Web3 development environment was like trying to set up a tent during a windstorm. I managed by:\n   - Following step-by-step guides like a scavenger hunt.\n   - Asking for help from online communities and friends (thank you, fellow nerds!).\n\n4.**Decentralized Concepts**: Grasping blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized identities took some time. I got hands-on by:\n   - Playing around with existing dApps to see how they worked.\n   - Building small prototypes to test concepts\u2014think of it as my Web3 science fair project.\n\n5.**Time Management**: Balancing learning and building during the hackathon was tricky. I survived by:\n   - Creating a structured schedule (who knew I could be organized?).\n   - Prioritizing core features and leaving the fancy stuff for later\u2014like saving the best toppings for last.\n\n6.**No Personal Laptop**: And let\u2019s not forget, I don\u2019t have my own laptop! I got through this by making some amazing friends who let me borrow theirs. Shoutout to them!\n\nDespite all these challenges, every hurdle was a learning opportunity that fueled my passion for Web3 development and solidified my commitment to",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nMy main motivation for participating in the hackathon is to build a product that brings an offline community online. The traditional cooperative lending system, known as Chit Funds in India, is centralized, with several go-through processes and third-party management. By decentralizing this model, I aim to offer a solution that\u2019s as seamless and user-friendly as its Web2 counterpart, while also bringing transparency and accessibility through blockchain.\n\nBase is the perfect fit for this project because it provides the scalability and low transaction fees essential for community-based lending. While Ethereum is known for its security, the high gas fees would make micro-contributions and frequent transactions too expensive for many users. Base, being a Layer 2 solution, offers the same security as Ethereum but with much lower costs and faster transactions, which is critical for fostering financial inclusion.\n\nParticipating in the hackathon felt like the right opportunity to build this on-chain cooperative lending solution in a real-world environment, showcasing how effectively it can function while solving key problems in the traditional system. \nIndian Region has a lot of people participating in Chit Funds, on both the large scale, and on a small scale(among friends), if I can bridge the gap between web2 and web3 using this we can onboard a lot of new people to web3.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWith the help of Base, I\u2019m addressing several key challenges in the traditional Chit Fund system and pushing for a more decentralized, transparent solution. Below are the challenges and the issues in traditional chit funds:\n### Lack of Transparency:\nTraditional chit funds are managed by a centralized third party, leading to concerns about transparency in how funds are handled.\nThe participants have no visibility into how the funds are distributed, which can lead to mistrust.\n###High Administrative Costs:\nTraditional chit funds involve various administrative overheads, including paperwork, agent commissions, and management fees, which reduce the net returns for participants.\n### Delayed or Unfair Payouts:\nPayouts may be delayed or unfairly influenced by the organizer. This can lead to unequal or biased distribution of the pooled funds.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\n### Transparency:\nEvery transaction is recorded on-chain, visible to all participants. This eliminates doubts about how funds are handled and ensures that the entire process is auditable.\n### Decentralization and Trustless Management:\nNo need for third-party intermediaries. Smart contracts automate collections, contributions, and payouts based on rules defined within the contract, removing the reliance on a middleman.\n### Lower Costs:\nWithout the need for manual administration and intermediaries, the administrative costs are greatly reduced, allowing participants to receive more of the total pool.\n### Global Participation and Accessibility:\nOn-chain chit funds remove geographic barriers, allowing anyone with internet access to participate, thus broadening the reach and inclusivity.\n### Fair and Automated Payouts:\nSmart contracts automatically enforce the rules, ensuring that payouts are fair and timely, based on predetermined conditions without human intervention.\n### Security Against Fraud:\nFunds are held in smart contracts, reducing the possibility of fraud or misappropriation by any single individual. Participants have greater security, knowing their funds are safe on-chain.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the significant challenges in building the ChitFund project was designing the contract flow and ensuring secure fund releases. The decentralized chit fund system needed careful planning for transparent and predictable contribution and disbursement cycles.\n### Challenge 1: Deciding the Contract Flow\nThe flow design was complex due to several factors:\n\n* Managing participant contributions\n* Ensuring funds went to correct recipients each cycle\n* Handling missed contribution deadlines\n\nI had to carefully design participant interactions with the contract, from staking collateral to making contributions and receiving pooled funds. The contract needed to respect timing and contribution order.\nSolution: I implemented event-driven logic and mapped each participant's contribution status to track payments and prevent premature fund disbursement. A modifier ensured only rightful recipients could claim funds for each cycle.\n### Challenge 2: Problem with Funds Not Being Released\nFunds weren't releasing from the contract after all contributions were made due to logic not properly accounting for complete contributions before triggering disbursement. This caused funds to remain locked even when contributions were complete.\nSolution: I revised the contract logic to automatically release pooled funds to eligible recipients once all cycle contributions were complete. I added a reentrancy guard to prevent multiple withdrawals per cycle and introduced proper state management to track contribution completion.\nThese challenges taught me valuable lessons about smart contract development:\n\n* Importance of thorough state management\n* Need for robust security measures\n* Value of clear contract flow design\n* Critical nature of proper fund release mechanisms\n\nThe solutions implemented not only resolved the immediate issues but also made the contract more secure and efficient.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are participating in the Based India hackathon to address a key challenge faced by local businesses and individuals: making cross-border payments faster and more efficient. \n\nHackathons like Based India provide an ideal platform to innovate and create impactful solutions tailored to real-world problems. By leveraging the Base Blockchain, we've crafted SwiftX to ensure seamless, instant transactions that help people connect financially across borders without the usual delays. Participating in this event allows us to showcase our work, learn from the community, and contribute to building better financial solutions for everyone.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe overall challenge we are trying to solve is around making cross border payments, at the moment due to time-zone differences a normal transaction takes upto atleast 24 hrs to complete. And in this time the recipent has to wait for that amount to continue with their operaptions. \n\nFor example a client in the US wants a manufacturer in India to start manufacturing a 1000 sets of toys, they would have to wait alteast for a day or two to get the payment and then start their manufacturing. This causes a lot of problems for the clients overseas and also for the local businesses to be effecient.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nSwiftX tackles the challenge of slow cross-border payments by introducing instant transactions using a dual-ledger system with blockchain tokens as guarantees. Instead of waiting for the traditional banking system to settle, our pledge model allows the receiving partner to disburse funds immediately, ensuring the recipient gets access to the money without delay. This means businesses can keep their operations.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the significant challenges we faced was **navigating regulatory compliance** across different jurisdictions. Ensuring that SwiftX meets all AML/KYC requirements while also enabling instant payments was complex, as each country has its own set of rules. We had to develop automated compliance checks that are flexible enough to adapt to varying regulations, which took considerable time and effort.\n\nAnother challenge was **balancing instant liquidity with security**. Providing instant payouts using blockchain tokens meant ensuring that the value was always accurately represented and secured, without risking double-spending or fraud. Developing a reliable system that could manage these risks while maintaining the speed of transactions required careful planning and multiple iterations.\n\nLastly, **scalability** was a significant focus. As we aim to handle increasing transaction volumes, ensuring that our infrastructure could grow without compromising on performance or security posed a challenge. We had to optimize our system to handle both large volumes of transactions and peak loads, which involved testing under various stress conditions to ensure stability.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n1. Multi-Currency Support: SwiftX supports multiple currencies, making it easier for businesses to handle payments across different countries without worrying about currency conversions.\n2. Instant Transaction Notifications: Users receive real-time notifications when payments are initiated, processed, or completed, providing transparency throughout the transaction lifecycle.\n3. Audit Trail and Reporting: The platform offers comprehensive audit trails and reporting tools to help businesses track and document all payment activities, ensuring transparency and easy access to transaction history.\n4. Integration with Existing Systems: SwiftX can be seamlessly integrated with existing financial systems and ERPs, minimizing disruptions and providing a smooth user experience.\n5. Smart Contract Automation: Key aspects of the transaction process, such as payment guarantees and compliance checks, are automated using smart contracts, reducing the risk of manual errors and speeding up transaction times.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nOver the past decade, I\u2019ve worked across various industries and products with a focus on making a tangible impact in people's everyday lives and accelerating value creation and exchange. India holds immense potential, not just as a consumer market but as a hub for builders and creators. I believe that once technology becomes simplified for this region, crypto adoption will accelerate rapidly, given how quickly we embrace new innovations. Especially, when people realize that technology offers them greater flexibility, control, and accessibility, mass adoption becomes inevitable.\nAs a firm believer in India\u2019s growth story, my goal is to simplify the adoption of ownership-based digital assets for developers and creators, while simultaneously expanding accessibility for consumers by enhancing distribution channels. With my passion for Web3, I see Based India as the perfect platform to connect with fellow innovators, builders, and visionaries. It's an exciting opportunity to share my experiences and learn from others while contributing to the future of blockchain applications in India.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nStreamNFT tackles several major challenges in the realm of ownership-based digital assets:\nLimited Utility of Digital Assets: Ownership-based digital assets are often confined to specific use cases, such as collectibles or single-purpose tokens, which restricts their broader applications across industries like education, entertainment, and business.\nRigid Ownership Models: The existing approach to digital assets revolves around full ownership, with limited options for temporary or shared access, preventing more dynamic models like rentals, borrowing, or shared rights.\nOne-Dimensional Nature: Owners can only work with one protocol at a time, limiting it\u2019s potential. Holders can\u2019t borrow while they have rented out an asset.\nLack of Liquidity: Digital asset markets frequently face liquidity constraints, making it hard for holders to leverage the value of their assets without outright selling them, limiting financial flexibility.\nFragmented User Experience: Users need to engage with multiple platforms for essential functions such as minting, trading, and accessing benefits tied to digital assets, leading to a fragmented and confusing user journey.\nConsumer Accessibility and Adoption: The complexity and lack of user-friendly platforms for ownership-based digital assets pose significant barriers to mainstream consumer adoption, making it harder for people to access, understand, and benefit from these new technologies.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nStreamNFT provides a unified platform for ownership-based digital assets, addressing key challenges by:\nExpanding utility beyond collectibles to include diverse assets like educational content and in-game items.\nOffering liquidity options through peer-to-peer rentals and borrowing, allowing asset holders to generate value without selling.\nIntroducing flexible ownership models such as time-limited access and shared ownership.\nSimplifying user experience by integrating minting, trading, renting, and borrowing into one platform.\nLowering barriers for developers and creators with user-friendly tools for tokenization and asset management.\nIntroducing composability among protocols to maximize utilization of asset in the economy \nStreamNFT is driving widespread adoption of ownership-based digital assets by enabling easier access and broader use cases across various industries. With features that offer greater financial flexibility, users can unlock value from their assets in new ways, fostering active participation in the ecosystem. The platform\u2019s seamless experience enhances user engagement, making it more intuitive and rewarding to interact with digital assets.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1.One of the major hurdles we faced was tied to the limitation of NFTs in the EVM ecosystem\u2014specifically, their inability to be locked or frozen in wallets. Coming from the Solana ecosystem, we were familiar with the benefits of locking NFTs, which enable escrowless and decentralized interactions. To overcome this, we proposed two new standards: ERC7066 and ERC7721. These standards are designed to introduce locking capabilities within the EVM ecosystem, allowing us and our partners to build truly decentralized solutions that mirror what is possible on Solana. This was a key innovation that opened up new possibilities for decentralized NFT use cases like renting and borrowing, without the need for centralized escrow.\n\n2.Another significant challenge involved managing user NFT data. Initially, we relied on third-party data providers, but this introduced latency due to multiple NFT data calls and complex data transformations. Moreover, many projects that do not yet support ERC7066 and ERC7721 required additional integration with our SDKs and APIs. To address these issues, we built a micro-service that supports interaction with third-party data providers, handles data transformation, implements caching, and even includes rented asset information in a single API call. This solution dramatically improved integration speed and reduced latency, providing our partners with a seamless experience through one streamlined API call.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nUtility contract has been added to the project stack, enabling users to discover and create NFT benefits on-chain, which can be claimed by owning or renting NFT.\nLoan Contract has been updated to support NFT pool, where users can come and demand custom lending rules for their specific NFTs.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am Jayveer from India, and I\u2019ve been deeply passionate about blockchain and NFTs for the past 3 years. As a blockchain developer and trader, I\u2019ve actively participated in this evolving space, from building projects to trading NFTs. However, the rise of NFT scams has become a major issue for both buyers and developers, and as someone who has personally faced such scams, I\u2019ve always felt the need to address this problem.\n\nBASE, with its ~0 gas fees and growing popularity, presents a perfect platform to bring about this change. I\u2019m participating in Based India because I believe this hackathon is the ideal opportunity to launch my innovative NFT launchpad that not only protects buyers but also builds trust between buyers and developers.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe main challenge I am focusing on is the **prevalence of scams within the NFT space.** \n\nWhile NFTs on BASE is going crazy these days but there\u2019s a huge trust deficit between buyers and developers due to projects that don\u2019t deliver on promises, leaving buyers vulnerable to financial losses. Another challenge is the confusing and difficult-to-navigate interfaces of existing NFT launchpads, which alienate many users. I aim to solve these issues\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nBASE NFTs are trending right now, and for good reason. With near-zero gas fees, BASE is quickly becoming a favorite blockchain for NFTs. However, as always, scammers are a persistent problem in the space. That's why I'm excited to introduce our innovative **On-Chain Burn and Earn** feature, built into our NFT launchpad. Our primary goal is to create a seamless and trustworthy platform where NFTs can be launched without confusion or the risk of scams.\n\nIn our system, buyers and developers agree on specific terms\u2014how long the mint funds will be held and the percentage that can be refunded. This feature provides buyers with peace of mind, knowing their investment is protected, while also fostering trust with developers.\n\nHere\u2019s an example to illustrate: Imagine a developer launches 111 NFTs and sets the **Burn Time** at 3 days with a **Refund Percentage** of 90%. Buyers mint the NFTs at 1 ETH each. Typically, this is where scams might occur\u2014developers disappear with the mint funds without fulfilling their promises. However, with the **Burn and Earn** feature, it\u2019s different. The 111 ETH from the mint is held securely for 3 days. If the developer fails to deliver on their commitments during this time, buyers can burn their NFTs and reclaim 90% of their investment.\n\nOn the other hand, if the developer is genuine and continues adding value, the burning of NFTs will reduce the supply, increasing rarity and potentially driving up demand for the remaining NFTs. This creates a win-win situation: buyers are protected, and developers can build trust within their community. By integrating the **Burn and Earn** feature, we\u2019re offering both security for buyers and a solid reputation-building tool for developers.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe\u2019re using Solidity to implement our unique **Burn to Earn** feature, and after successfully completing the code, our internal tests have shown promising results.\n\nHowever, building the entire infrastructure\u2014from the backend code to the frontend UI\u2014takes considerable time. While we\u2019ve made great progress in testing and refining the core features, the real challenge now lies in bringing everything together. This includes not only the Solidity-based contract but also HTML for the interface, UI design, and integrating social media and marketing strategies. Managing all these aspects simultaneously has proven to be time-consuming, but we remain focused on delivering a seamless and efficient product.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe came up with this idea about a month ago, before we knew about the Buildathon. It was only two days before the event that we learned about it. Had we known earlier, we would have been able to present a fully functional NFT launchpad, complete with an eye-catching UI, and both the backend and frontend fully integrated. However, due to the limited time, we focused on showcasing demo images and a basic explanation video to convey our concept effectively within the short timeframe."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nThe travel landscape is evolving, and so are the needs of modern, community-driven ecosystems like Crash. Traditional airline loyalty programs often fall short in addressing the unique requirements of web3 communities, where travel is not just about reaching a destination, but about fostering connections, attending events, and driving innovation.\nAs an active member of the Crash community and a frequent traveler, I've recognized the potential to transform conventional airmiles into a dynamic, community-centric reward system. HighMiles is born from this vision \u2013 a decentralized travel incentive program that aligns with the Crash community's ethos and enhances the overall experience of our members.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n1. Limited utility and efficient utilisation of traditional loyalty programs within the web3 ecosystem\n2. Lack of community engagement in current travel reward systems\n3. Absence of social elements in travel planning and rewards\n4. High barrier to entry for non-web3 users in blockchain-based solutions\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nHighMiles transforms the concept of travel rewards to better serve the Crash community and beyond:\n1. Ecosystem Integration: Convert traditional airmiles into onchain attributes, accesable across the web3 ecosystem.\n2. Community-Driven Rewards: Implement a system where engagement with the Crash community enhances travel benefits.\n3. Event Access: Facilitate the use of HighMiles for conference tickets, hackathon entries, and hacker house discounts.\n4. Social Travel Planning: Enable community members to coordinate travel, share costs, and earn bonuses for group activities.\n5. Flexible Redemption: Expand the utility of travel points beyond just flights and hotels.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of HighMiles, we encountered several significant technical and practical challenges. Overcoming these hurdles has been crucial in creating a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform. Here are some of the key challenges we faced:\n\n1. Finding API to Get Proper Ticket Data:\n- Integrating with airline systems to access real-time, accurate ticket data proved to be complex.\nMany existing APIs were either limited in scope or lacked the comprehensive data we needed.\nWe had to negotiate with multiple airlines and aggregators to secure reliable data sources.\nSolution: We developed a custom API integration layer that combines data from multiple sources, ensuring comprehensive and up-to-date ticket information.\n\n2. Calculating Airmiles:\n- Different airlines use varied formulas to calculate airmiles, making standardization difficult.\nFactors like fare class, route, and promotional offers added complexity to the calculations.\nEnsuring fair conversion of traditional airmiles to HighMiles tokens required careful consideration.\nSolution: We implemented a dynamic calculation engine that takes into account multiple factors and uses machine learning to adjust and improve conversion rates over time.\n\n3.Building Smart Contracts with Privacy-Preserving Verification:\n- Creating a system that verifies individuals while keeping their personal information secret was a significant challenge.\nImplementing zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) in smart contracts required advanced cryptographic knowledge.\nBalancing privacy with the need for transparency in a blockchain-based system was complex.\nSolution: We developed a custom ZK-SNARK implementation that allows for user verification without exposing personal data on-chain. This ensures user privacy while maintaining the integrity of the HighMiles ecosystem.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n1. Flexible Accommodation Booking: Use HighMiles to book various types of stays, from traditional hotels to community-hosted spaces.\n2. Quest System: Engage members with community challenges that earn bonus miles and special statuses, accessible to all users regardless of their web3 experience.\n3. Sustainability Initiative: Option to allocate miles towards carbon offset projects, promoting responsible travel.",

To build a relevant use case, and getting acquainted with different protocols and tech stack along the way\n2. To gain visibility across Base ecosystem\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nTalent Protocol is storing actions of base users, wrt identity (basenames), activity, and builder credentials, which are what I've integrated in my dapp. The idea behind my dapp is rooted in the observation that during each crypto bull cycle, on-chain users typically engage in token farming, often indulging in unfair practices to increase their token amount. So, instead of traditional airdrops, the Pooldrop approach allows dapps and protocols to incentivize genuine on-chain activity and reward authentic web3 users and builders. This is achieved by distributing tokens to users' wallets based on specific predefined conditions.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nI've made a small PoC that uses real on-chain data from Talent Protocol. It shows how protocols or anyone for that matter can reward active on-chain users and builders based on certain conditions. This demo has a few pre-set options and criterias, but there are endless possibilities for how this could be used. What I've created for the hackathon is just the beginning.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSince the records being fetched from Talent Protocol was quite a lot (more than a million rows), the most challening part was to fetch the data, clean it, sort it by column, jump to a particular page and show the records of that particular page, etc. Made use of PostgreSQL via Supabase and handled it pretty neatly after exploring a few options of how it can be handled efficiently.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nAs a developer passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, I believe the Based India hackathon offers a unique platform to present Propertyproof, a decentralized solution aimed at addressing property fraud, which is a widespread issue in both developing and developed countries.\n\nIndia, with its rapidly growing tech ecosystem and forward-thinking approach to blockchain, is an ideal region to showcase innovative blockchain applications. The country faces similar challenges in property ownership transparency, making Propertyproof highly relevant. By participating, I aim to connect with the vibrant Indian tech community, learn from diverse perspectives, and contribute to solving a shared global problem\u2014fraud in property management.\n\nThis hackathon also provides an opportunity to scale the project for a global impact, with India as a key market. By engaging in Based India, I hope to inspire solutions that transcend borders, tackling fraud, corruption, and inefficiencies in property management worldwide.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn many developing countries, including my own, property fraud and corruption are rampant. Cases of land being sold to multiple individuals or fake ownership documents are common, leading to disputes, financial loss, and a lack of trust in the property registry system. This undermines economic development and creates legal and social instability in communities.\n\nWith the help of Base, Propertyproof is tackling these challenges by providing a decentralized platform for transparent, secure, and tamper-proof property ownership records. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce corruption, and empower individuals to verify property ownership directly. The platform also addresses issues like slow bureaucratic processes, errors in record-keeping, and inefficiencies in land administration systems.\n\nBase\u2019s Layer 2 solution plays a key role in making this possible. It enhances the scalability and performance of the platform, ensuring low transaction fees and faster processing times. This enables Propertyproof to serve a larger user base, ensuring accessibility for everyone, from local communities to NGOs and governmental bodies, without the high costs often associated with blockchain transactions.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, we aim to restore trust in property ownership systems, protect individuals' rights, and ultimately contribute to more transparent governance and economic development in the community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nPropertyproof directly tackles the challenge of property fraud and corruption by leveraging the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology. Traditional property registry systems in developing countries are prone to inefficiencies, manual errors, and deliberate fraud, which often result in disputes, financial losses, and mistrust among communities. Our platform provides a solution to these problems by creating a decentralized property registry where ownership records are securely stored, verified, and publicly accessible without intermediaries.\n\nThrough smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain, Propertyproof ensures that once property ownership is recorded, it cannot be altered or manipulated. This prevents multiple sales of the same property and eliminates the need for individuals to rely on corrupt officials or paper records, which are often tampered with or lost. Our system also enables real-time verification of ownership, allowing anyone to independently confirm property details, significantly reducing the risk of fraud.\n\nBy utilizing Base\u2019s Layer 2 solution, Propertyproof achieves high scalability and low transaction costs, making the platform accessible to a wider audience, including those in underserved communities. The use of Base also ensures that the platform can handle a large volume of transactions efficiently, ensuring users do not face prohibitive fees or delays in registering or transferring properties.\n\nThe potential impact of Propertyproof is immense. By reducing property fraud and enhancing transparency, we aim to restore trust in land administration systems, protect property rights, and create a more equitable environment for land ownership. This will empower individuals, reduce legal disputes, and contribute to the broader goal of sustainable economic development by creating a reliable framework for property ownership.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the major issues I faced was running out of testnet ETH, which is crucial for deploying and testing smart contracts on the blockchain. Without it, I was unable to continue testing the project\u2019s functionality. Thankfully, Demi stepped in and sent me some testnet ETH, allowing me to push through this roadblock and proceed with the testing phase. This experience highlighted the importance of community support and collaboration in blockchain development.\nAnother significant challenge was working under pressure with a small team. Since we had limited manpower, I had to take on multiple roles, managing both the technical aspects like coding and debugging, as well as non-technical tasks like documentation and project coordination. This required me to go the extra mile, putting in long hours to ensure everything was on track. The experience was stressful at times, but it pushed me to stay focused, manage my time effectively, and ultimately meet the deadlines.\nTechnical bugs were another hurdle that slowed down the project\u2019s progress. Both the smart contracts and frontend interface encountered issues that needed immediate attention. Instead of getting discouraged, I turned to YouTube tutorials and combed through developer documentation to troubleshoot and resolve these bugs. This process involved a lot of research and testing, but the satisfaction of solving these problems made it worthwhile. It reinforced the importance of continuous learning in overcoming technical obstacles.\nA non-technical challenge I faced was internet connectivity issues. At a critical point in the project, I didn\u2019t have a stable internet connection and couldn\u2019t afford to buy more data. This could have delayed the project, but my neighbor kindly lent me access to his WiFi after I promised to repay him later. His generosity allowed me to stay online and continue working, ensuring the project\u2019s momentum wasn\u2019t lost.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nAlthough Propertyproof had been in development prior to the Buildathon, several key features were introduced and refined during the event to enhance its functionality and scalability:\n1. Integration with Base Layer 2:  \n   One of the most significant additions was the integration of Base Layer 2 for improved scalability and reduced transaction fees. This was essential for ensuring the platform could handle a higher volume of transactions efficiently, making it more accessible to users in developing regions where high gas fees could be a barrier.\n2. Enhanced Property Transfer Mechanism:  \nI added an improved property transfer mechanism to streamline the process of transferring property ownership between parties. This feature includes enhanced security measures, such as the use of modifiers to ensure only asset owners can initiate transfers, and event logging to track the transfer of assets for transparency.\n3. User-Friendly Frontend Interface:  \n   To make the platform more accessible to non-technical users, I focused on improving the frontend interface. This involved simplifying the design using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and ensuring seamless integration with Metamask for Ethereum wallet management. The user experience was a top priority, as the goal is to enable even first-time users to navigate and verify property ownership with ease.\n4. Advanced Security Features:  \nDuring the Buildathon, I implemented additional security features to safeguard user data and property records. These included the use of smart contract modifiers to control access to sensitive functions and further validation checks to prevent unauthorized transactions or manipulations of property data.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nIn conclusion, my motivation for participating in the Based India hackathon stems from a deep belief in the power of decentralized networks to empower individuals and transform communities. Through my project, we aim to create an engaging gaming experience that not only drives user retention but also rewards contributors in a cost-effective manner.\n\nBy leveraging the strengths of the Based network and engaging with fellow innovators, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. We eager to demonstrate our project and contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the potential of decentralized solutions in India through DeCharge Network\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nChallenges Addressed by the Project\n\nIn developing my project for the hackathon, I am focusing on several key challenges faced by decentralized networks:\n\n1. User Retention: User onboarding sucks. Retaining UX is even worse\n\nBy integrating gamified elements that reward users for ongoing participation, ensuring they feel valued and motivated to return.\n\n2. Accessibility: Economic barriers often prevent users from engaging fully with decentralized networks. I aim to create a cost-effective solution that lowers these barriers, enabling a diverse range of users to participate and benefit from the network.\n\n3. Incentivizing Contributions: Users frequently feel like passive consumers. By implementing a robust rewards system, my project encourages active participation. I'm able to leverage base while speaking to the customers without having to use fancy buzzwords such as DePIN\n\n4. Building a Sustainable Ecosystem: A self-sustaining network is essential for long-term success. By promoting user engagement through rewards, we can ensure organic growth, enhancing user satisfaction and network longevity.\n\n5. Community Engagement: Fostering collaboration among users is vital. My project encourages teamwork through shared gaming experiences, building a supportive community that thrives on mutual success. We are happy to share part of the code so innovative extensions can be built on similar usecases\n\n6. Education and Awareness: Many potential users are unaware of decentralized network benefits. My project includes educational resources to inform users about engagement opportunities, empowering them to maximize their participation.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, my project aims to create an engaging, inclusive, and sustainable decentralized ecosystem that empowers users and fosters a vibrant community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nWhile we already had a working network of Charging Infra, our core clients were the business partners while there was a better need to also onboard the users directly. With the help of our business partners, we were able to engage with the users directly while creating a beautiful onchain experience by starting on a simple mindshare exercise ~ which is basically Charge & Earn.\n\nIn the medium-to-long run, we intend to educate the users on the economic and energy efficient ways of electricity consumption in their day to day lives. Our users are already users of EVs as part of their daily gig work. By enabling them onto a charge & earn experience I would be able to eventually onboard them towards sustainable utility of public charging infrastructure.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of my project, I encountered several significant hurdles, particularly related to user drop-off and engagement. One of the primary challenges was establishing a robust infrastructure network that could support consistent user interaction. Initially, users were incentivized with cryptocurrency rewards for charging at public infrastructure, but many still dropped off due to a lack of meaningful engagement and the perceived complexity of the system.\n\nTransforming consumer habits in India is inherently difficult and costly. Large multinational corporations invest billions trying to influence user behavior, and my project faced similar challenges. Users are often resistant to change, especially when it involves adopting new technologies or altering their daily routines.\n\nTo address these issues, we introduced a consumer-friendly approach, integrating gamification and more relatable incentives into the user experience. By creating an engaging platform that rewards users not just for participation but also for achieving specific milestones, I aimed to foster a sense of community and ongoing involvement. This shift has allowed me to retain customers more effectively by making the experience enjoyable and rewarding in a way that resonates with their everyday lives.\n\nDuring development, there were a few challenges as we had encountered in running the scripts in the latest versions, we were able to debug the issues and focus on creating unique onchain experiences on controlled Testnet UX. There are two instances of the project were both new user & existing onchain user is able to use the app for claiming rewards.\n\nWe still had issues in terms of executing smart contract code involving the Base names on Sepolia, we are hoping to have it fixed so our users can have the on-chain experience of claiming a name with just their local phone number!\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe shipped the project over a week while creating the base on-chain experience over the weekend. Our physical onground infra and existing has been existing over the last 5 months.\n\nWhy Charge & Earn on-chain app?\n\nFor on-chain apps looking to build successful businesses, they need a strong retention mapping for new users who are looking for unique experiences that makes them return to the platform experience over and over again.\n\nIn our cases, this is the on-chain app that is gonna help achieve it! We already have close to 500 regular customers through our charging infra while having a retention rate of 63%. Using this on-chain app experience, we hope to improve the retention and customer happiness quotient since it suits well for our gig economy of EV riders looking to have fun and earn the extra buck!",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am from India and I feel that the general society looks at the web3 and blockchain industry as a bad industry where scams happen and people just loose their money. What folks don't see is that crypto is just a part of this industry and not the entire thing. There are so many technological principles involved in working with blockchain and decentralised systems that if they are used in our daily computing/consumer applications, these concepts can make a lot of things better and secure.\n\nI understand that building applications that are web2-friendly, and are made to help solve problems in lives of everyone, can actually really help in the adoption of these technologies. The jargons and terminologies can be safely abstracted away from users without them having to face a steep learning curve of understanding things.\n\nIf we look at my parents generation itself, for the maximum part, they did not understand the usage of smart phones. But once technology grew, internet became more and more advanced, many things in life became more and more accessible through a device that you can travel with everyday in your pocket. And now even the older generation knows how to use smart phones. How? because of such consumer apps that helped users by making their lives easier, and the users were attracted towards learning and using the smart phone.\n\nIn web3's case, we can actually make UX and User Journeys simple so that people don't have to face in-depth technology, but just appreciate the fact how decentralisation is making their lives easier, transparent and more secure.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nMain focus: Challenge of having local communities greater transparency, participation, and control over their shared assets and infrastructure through decentralized governance. In many residential and commercial communities, there is a lack of clear processes for fund allocation, decision-making, and member participation. This can lead to centralised control, mismanagement, lack of accountability, and a disconnect between community members and their admins. And traditional models for community ownership and management are often opaque and involve intermediaries, which can delay important decisions and create a sense of mistrust among members.\nThis project serves as an MVP and a sort of collection of building blocks for a bigger and more advanced project. The key features of this MVP are:\n1. Transparent voting: Ensuring community proposals are discussed as intended and voted on by members.\n2. Fund management: Ensuring community funds are used as intended.\n3. Seamless member participation: Enabling members to vote on decisions, and propose initiatives.\n4. Decentralized governance: Removing reliance on centralized authorities and intermediaries, empowering communities to manage themselves more effectively.\n5. Easy onboarding and usability: Making the system simple enough for non-technical users to participate, without needing to understand blockchain or web3 jargon.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, our project aims to democratize decision-making for local communities and allow them to have ownership of shared resources and governance processes.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nWhile still being an MVP, this submission provides a decentralized platform that allows communities, both residential and commercial, to manage memberships, vote on proposals, and collect shared funds.\n\nKey features include:\n\n1. Tokenized memberships (ERC-721 NFTs): Each community member holds an NFT representing their participation in the community. Currently voting rights are based in the form of each member having 1 voting power to ensure equality. And voters are shown to maintain transparency while decision making.\nPotential Future Feature: Votes can be made hidden for privacy-centric proposals, with higher number of options and also allowing for making funding proposals transparent.\n2. Safe Wallet SDK integration: We use Safe wallets to securely manage community funds.\n3. Seamless onboarding with Privy: To remove barriers to entry, we utilize Privy for easy onboarding using google login, allowing even non-technical users to join and participate in the platform without needing to deal with private keys or blockchain terminology.\n4. Real-world compliance, on-chain immutability: While compliance is handled off-chain, our solution ensures that key actions such as fund collection and voting are immutably recorded on-chain, enhancing trust and transparency.\n\nThis solution empowers communities to self-govern effectively, offering transparency, fairness, and ease of use through a decentralized system. It removes intermediaries and enables real-world communities to manage their assets in a secure, efficient, and participatory way.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nI am taking part in this hackathon as a single person. I am a web2 developer by profession, with web3 experience of past projects. This is my first time working on a full project solo, so it was a tedious task getting it done in time with all features ready as I wanted them to be. Along with that I am still new to using Cursor AI so figuring out the right way of prompt engineering was something I also learned on the go.\n\nOn core technical part, designing and then properly building a POC form of smart contracts to serve as building blocks for a much more grand and in-future project was a task that took some time. And then from frontend I would say I faced a decent number of bugs in working with proposals on how to make them easy to understand through the UX.\n\nThinking about easy to understand design was definitely a challenge, which i overcame by discussing the design with my parents, if it was straightforward for them or not (which it was :))",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am participating in Based India because I believe in leveraging technology and blockchain innovation to solve real-world challenges. India's rich natural landscapes and biodiversity are at risk, and I see this as a unique opportunity to use crypto to fund land conservation efforts. With basedLAND, I aim to inspire the next generation of environmentally conscious crypto investors, aligning speculative interests with ecological preservation. My connection to the region stems from a deep appreciation for India's natural beauty and the urgent need for sustainable initiatives.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI am addressing the challenge of funding land conservation and sustainability projects in India. Traditional funding mechanisms for these causes are often slow and inefficient, leaving critical ecological areas vulnerable. There is also a disconnect between retail investors in the crypto space and real-world environmental causes. With the help of Base, I\u2019m focusing on bridging this gap by creating speculative financial incentives that encourage participation in land conservation and sustainable development.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project, basedLAND, directly tackles this challenge by creating a speculative token that rewards participants with both financial returns and tangible eco-impact. Holders of $basedLAND can stake their tokens and earn $STAY tokens, which are used to access accommodation in eco-friendly villages and conservation sites. By utilizing the Base blockchain, our project ensures transparency, security, and scalability, all while driving funds towards land conservation projects. This aligns with the goal of engaging crypto enthusiasts to take action for India\u2019s environment, offering them both utility and a speculative upside.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne technical hurdle we encountered was integrating staking and reward mechanisms in a secure manner while ensuring the process remains decentralized. We had to optimize smart contracts to calculate staking rewards based on time frames without compromising security or speed. Non-technical challenges included educating retail investors on how their speculative investments directly fund conservation efforts. To overcome these, we created a clear communication strategy using infographics, videos, and community engagement campaigns to bridge the knowledge gap.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nOur project was initially built with the core $basedLAND staking mechanism in place. During the Buildathon, we added new features such as $STAY token integration for accommodation utility and a governance model for decentralized decision-making. We also implemented proof-of-presence smart contracts to ensure that users could temporarily lock their $STAY tokens for perpetual usage, enhancing long-term engagement and sustainability."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are a team from IIT Roorkee and we are participating in the Base India Hackathon to showcase our innovative automatic incentivization platform for blockchain networks. Our project leverages user activity, specifically analyzing GitHub engagement, to automate the airdrop creation process and ensure that only eligible users are selected for rewards. By integrating with Eigenlayer's Actively Validated Service powered by Othentic, we ensure that our incentivization mechanism is not only efficient but also fair and decentralized.\nWe believe this to be an excellent project which will be very useful to the community. Our future goals are to expand our analysis beyond GitHub to platforms such as Twitter (which require a paid API for scraping user data). By participating and submitting this project at Based India, we are taking the first step for making a tangible solution for our idea.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOur primary focus was to create a PoC of an automatic incentivisation platform, running on Eigenlayer to ensure results generated by the application were subject to re-execution and decentralisation. Often during airdrops and other similar incentivisation events, it is difficult for network creators to fairly and easily create user rewards which would actually result in increase in network adoption and usage. It is important to carefully select and reward users with long term associations to the network as well as incentivise new potential users reliably.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThe automatic incentivization platform leverages a decentralized network built on Eigenlayer, designed to optimize reward distribution based on user metrics collected from various platforms. By analyzing user engagement and activity, the platform implements a proportionate reward system that ensures users are compensated fairly for their contributions. This innovative approach not only enhances user participation but also promotes a more equitable ecosystem within the blockchain network, fostering increased engagement and incentivizing positive user behavior.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nGetting user data from different platforms was a challenge. Most of the social platforms required to use costly APIs. Determining the various factors for assigning rewards was also difficult. Additionally, implementing an AVS and deploying it was also a tough hurdle.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI\u2019m participating in Based India to help solve real-world financial challenges in underserved communities especially by using Base chain. By leveraging blockchain technology, I aim to create decentralized solutions that promote financial inclusion and empower local communities.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe challenges I'm focusing on include limited financial access, high interest rates, and a lack of trust in traditional banking systems. My project addresses these by creating a decentralized savings pool that empowers communities to manage their own funds securely and transparently.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy submission, Base Funds, addresses these challenges by offering a decentralized community savings pool that allows members to contribute and borrow securely using smart contracts. This eliminates the need for traditional banks, reduces high interest rates, and builds trust through transparent, fast transactions on Base. It empowers communities to manage their finances autonomously, promoting financial inclusion.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart Wallet Integration :-  Integrating a smart wallet posed initial difficulties, particularly ensuring smooth interaction between the wallet and the community dashboard. I resolved this through rigorous testing .\n\nUser Access Control :-  Managing who could contribute and borrow from the pool required strict access controls. We implemented smart contracts to ensure only eligible community members can participate, enforcing secure access.\n\nCross-chain Flexibility (Ongoing) :-  While we aim to implement cross-chain compatibility for even greater flexibility, this feature is still in progress. Our future updates will focus on enabling seamless interactions across multiple blockchains.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nI built this project entirely during the Buildathon; there was no previous work. While exploring the builder resources for ideas, I navigated to the provided link and chose to focus on creating a decentralized community savings pool. This idea stood out to me as it addresses significant financial challenges faced by communities.

However, many users in India, particularly those in emerging markets, are deterred by high transaction costs on blockchain networks. By participating in this hackathon, I aim to build a solution that can promote inclusion by enabling microtransactions without gas fees, making blockchain accessible to all. This project is rooted in my desire to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem in India and offer solutions that make decentralized finance (DeFi) usable for everyone.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for decentralized applications in India, especially for small creators and users, is the high cost of gas fees, making microtransactions unfeasible. This is especially important for people in regions where smaller payments can represent a larger proportion of income. We\u2019re also addressing the lack of infrastructure for simple social tipping mechanisms on Base that could encourage broader adoption of decentralized technologies.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project enables gasless microtransactions using meta-transactions, where users sign transactions without paying gas, and a relayer submits the transactions to the Base blockchain. This solution allows small content creators and regular users to tip and engage with social platforms without worrying about gas fees, thereby creating a more accessible and inclusive ecosystem for microtransactions. The potential impact includes fostering greater interaction on decentralized social apps, improving adoption, and supporting creators with small but meaningful contributions.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nMeta-transaction implementation: One of the biggest technical hurdles was implementing the meta-transaction structure where users could sign transactions off-chain. Understanding and incorporating EIP-712 was key to overcoming this challenge.\nRelayer coordination: Managing a smooth user experience while running the relayer required addressing challenges in gas cost management and ensuring timely transaction processing.\nTesting on Base: Simulating different network conditions for users with limited bandwidth in India helped to ensure the app could be widely adopted."

With its vast talent pool and growing digital ecosystem, the region offers an incredible opportunity to develop solutions that address local and global challenges. I'm motivated to contribute to the thriving blockchain community in India, as well as leverage the vast user base to test and implement decentralized solutions that can scale. I believe blockchain can play a transformative role in sectors like finance, education, and healthcare, areas critical for India\u2019s continued growth.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI'm focusing on the challenge of document and file authenticity. In many regions, including Southeast Asia, there is a growing need for reliable, secure, and transparent methods to verify the integrity of documents. Fraudulent certifications, fake documents, and manipulation of data are significant problems that can damage trust in both public and private institutions.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy project, Decentralized File Verification (DFV), addresses the challenge of file authenticity by allowing users to upload files, generate cryptographic hashes, and store these hashes on the blockchain. This ensures that any changes to the original document can be detected, making it easy to verify the integrity of critical files. The solution can be used for verifying certificates, contracts, legal documents, and more, providing an immutable, tamper-proof record stored on the Base blockchain. This builds trust and ensures transparency in document management for both individuals and organizations.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne technical challenge was integrating IPFS for decentralized file storage. Initially, I faced difficulties managing the IPFS upload flow and linking it with the blockchain-based file hash verification. I overcame this by modularizing the file upload process and ensuring IPFS could handle large files efficiently. Additionally, I had to optimize the gas usage of the smart contract, which was solved by refactoring some logic to ensure cost-effective interaction with the Base blockchain."

Additionally, India has a massive mobile-first population that could benefit from privacy-centric and incentivized fitness solutions like Verifit, making it an ideal region to drive adoption.\n\nMy connection to the region stems from my roots and understanding of India's tech landscape, which is rapidly evolving into a hub for blockchain projects. I'm motivated to participate in Based India because I want to be part of this revolution, fostering decentralization and user empowerment through secure, innovative applications.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn **Verifit**, I'm focusing on addressing several key challenges in the fitness and Web3 communities with the help of Base:\n\n1. **Partial Privacy in Fitness Verification**: Traditional fitness apps require users to share detailed personal data to verify their goals. However, full privacy isn't always needed. Verifit leverages **verifiable zkProofs by Reclaim's zkFetch**, which offer a balance between privacy and transparency. This allows users to prove their fitness achievements without sharing sensitive information, but still allows the verification of claims.\n\n2. **Decentralized Accountability**: Staying motivated to meet fitness goals is challenging, especially without accountability systems. Verifit introduces **private accountability bets** where users commit to fitness goals, placing financial stakes on their success. If they miss a goal, part of their stake is forfeited. This decentralized mechanism ensures motivation through smart contracts without the need for a third party.\n\n3. **Seamless User Experience in Web3**: Managing wallets and signing transactions is often cumbersome for users in decentralized apps. With **Coinbase Smart Wallets** and **session keys** on Base, Verifit makes this process frictionless. Users can engage in high-frequency prediction markets or accountability bets without repeatedly signing transactions, enhancing usability for mainstream adoption.\n\n4. **Incentivizing Healthy Habits**: Consistency is key in fitness, but maintaining it is hard. Verifit addresses this by offering weekly rewards such as **SponsoredBasenameRegistration** for users who meet step goals consistently for 7 days. This gamifies the fitness experience while providing tangible rewards through blockchain technology.\n\nBy using **Base**, Verifit benefits from a scalable, low-cost Layer 2 platform that makes these decentralized features affordable and accessible to a broad audience\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nAt its core, Verifit combines two primary functionalities: **private accountability bets** and **public prediction markets**. Users can place bets on their ability to meet fitness goals, adding a financial incentive to stay motivated. If they fail to submit proof of their achievements by the deadline, their stake is reduced exponentially. This decentralized accountability system fosters a sense of responsibility and engagement, making fitness a more interactive experience.\n\nThe public prediction markets feature incorporates a gamified element, allowing users to predict the fitness success of others in a fun, Tinder-style interface. Users swipe right for \"yes\" or left for \"no,\" making quick, engaging decisions that enhance social interaction within the fitness community. This not only encourages competition but also strengthens the network of accountability among users.\n\nVerifit utilizes **Coinbase Smart Wallets** and **session keys** to create a frictionless user experience, allowing for quick and easy transactions without the need for constant wallet interactions. This approach makes the platform accessible to a wider audience, including those who may be new to Web3 technology.\n\nThe potential impact of Verifit extends beyond individual fitness. By offering a decentralized solution, the app can foster healthier lifestyles within communities, especially in regions like India, where a mobile-first population is eager for innovative health tech solutions. Verifit not only incentivizes users to maintain their fitness goals but also educates them about blockchain and decentralized finance through engaging, rewarding experiences. Ultimately, Verifit aims to revolutionize the fitness industry by marrying health and technology, promoting accountability, and enhancing user privacy in an increasingly digital world.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### Challenges I Ran Into\n\n1. **Session Key Integration**:  \n   One of the significant hurdles was the integration of **Coinbase Smart Wallet session keys**, which are not yet launched for production. I aimed to create a seamless user experience in the prediction markets, allowing users to participate without frequent wallet interactions. The absence of session keys in a stable environment created complications in implementing this feature effectively.\n\n2. **Persistent Key Storage**:  \n   I encountered issues with storing session keys persistently. Initially, I attempted to store the keys in **local storage**, but ran into problems because the P-256 public keys are not strings. This led to challenges when trying to parse them as strings, which caused errors in retrieval and use.\n\n3. **Switching to IndexedDB**:  \n   After realizing the limitations of local storage, I decided to explore **IndexedDB** for key storage, which I learned about for the first time during this process. While transitioning to IndexedDB presented its own set of challenges\u2014such as understanding its asynchronous nature and how to structure the database\u2014I eventually figured it out successfully.\n\n### Solutions\n\n- To overcome the **session key integration** hurdle, I focused on alternative strategies for user authentication and transaction signing that didn't rely on session keys. This included using standard wallet connection methods until the session keys become available in a production environment.\n\n- For the **persistent key storage** issue, I researched IndexedDB thoroughly, including its advantages over local storage. I followed tutorials and documentation to understand how to set up and manage the database effectively. By implementing IndexedDB, I was able to create a robust solution that allowed for reliable storage and retrieval of session keys.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n### Additional Features\n\nVerifit was originally ideated at **ETHOnline 2024**, where I developed an MVP that leveraged the **Sign Protocol** and won the award for **Best ZK Attestation Verifier With Schema Hooks**. During the Buildathon, several significant enhancements were made to elevate the project:\n\n1. **Migration to Base Sepolia**:  \n   One of the most impactful changes was moving the entire project to **Base Sepolia**. This transition allowed for enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs, making Verifit more accessible to users.\n\n2. **Public Prediction Markets**:  \n   I introduced **public prediction markets**, which enable users to engage with others by betting on their fitness outcomes. This gamified element enhances user interaction and community engagement, adding a competitive layer to the fitness tracking experience.\n\n3. **Integration of Coinbase Smart Wallet Session Keys**:  \n   To improve the user experience further, I integrated **Coinbase Smart Wallet session keys**. This allows users to participate in prediction markets and accountability bets without the hassle of frequent wallet signing, streamlining interactions and making the app more user-friendly.\n\n4. **Weekly Reward Mechanisms**:  \n   I implemented a **weekly rewards system** that incentivizes users to maintain consistent fitness habits. Users can earn rewards, such as a free basename, for achieving their step goals for seven consecutive days. This feature not only promotes long-term engagement but also gamifies the experience, encouraging healthier lifestyles.\n\nThese enhancements have significantly improved Verifit\u2019s functionality and user experience, making it a more robust and engaging platform for decentralized fitness accountability.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe\u2019re participating in Base India because we believe that Web3 has massive, untapped potential to solve real-world challenges, yet it remains underappreciated, particularly in our communities. With our one-stop DeFi solution, we aim to make decentralized finance easily accessible to everyone, offering all essential financial services\u2014instant payments, earning opportunities, credit tracking, insurance, and more\u2014in one seamless platform.\n\nBy building on Base\u2019s infrastructure, we want to empower people with a user-friendly, comprehensive solution that breaks down barriers to entry and provides everything users need in one place. This isn\u2019t just about technology; it\u2019s about enabling individuals to take control of their financial futures, bringing financial services within easy reach of everyone. Base India is the perfect launchpad to create transformative, onchain solutions that address the needs of our communities, helping us build a future where everyone thrives.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on several key challenges in our community with the help of Base, including:\n\n- Lack of accessible insurance options, leaving many individuals financially vulnerable to unforeseen risks.\n- Difficulty in bridging real-world assets (RWA) with blockchain technology, limiting opportunities for people to tokenize and invest in physical assets.\n- Fragmentation across blockchains, making cross-chain token transfers cumbersome and reducing liquidity across ecosystems.\n- Limited access to transparent and efficient crowdfunding tools, making it hard for communities to raise funds for meaningful projects.\n- Inadequate systems for tracking credit scores in a decentralized manner, which hinders financial credibility and access to services for users.\n- A need to incentivize participation in DeFi platforms, with no straightforward way for users to earn and redeem rewards for their activities.\n- The complexity of navigating multiple platforms for financial services, resulting in a fragmented and unreliable user experience.\n\nThese are the challenges we\u2019re addressing to create a more accessible, all-in-one DeFi solution for everyone.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission addresses community challenges by providing a comprehensive, all-in-one DeFi platform that simplifies access to essential financial services. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Insurance (Insurance Contract): We integrate decentralized insurance solutions for easy access to coverage against financial risks.\n2. Real World Assets (PropertyNFT Contract): Our platform enables the tokenization of physical assets, bridging the gap between real-world investments and blockchain.\n3. Cross-Chain Token Transfer(TokenTransferor Contract): We support seamless cross-chain transfers, enhancing liquidity and usability across blockchain networks.\n4. Crowdfunding(BetterIndia Contract): Our decentralized tools empower projects and individuals to raise funds transparently and efficiently.\n5. Credit Score Tracking(People Contract): We offer a decentralized system to track onchain activity, helping users establish and improve their financial credibility.\n6. KBR Token Rewards(KBRToken Contract): Users earn KBR tokens for platform activities, creating an ecosystem for redeeming rewards for merchandise.\n7. All-in-One Platform: By consolidating these features, we provide a reliable and accessible solution for managing financial needs in one place.\n\nThe potential impact of our project is significant: by simplifying financial services and decentralizing systems like credit scoring and insurance, we empower users with greater financial autonomy, trust, and inclusivity. Through the Base infrastructure, we aim to make DeFi more approachable and transformative for our community.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges we ran into include several technical and non-technical hurdles throughout the development of our project:\n\n1. Different Contract Management: Coordinating interactions between various smart contracts required meticulous management of contract addresses and interfaces. We developed a robust contract management system that maintains a centralized registry of contract addresses and their corresponding functions, streamlining interactions and ensuring updates could be made without disrupting platform functionality.\n\n2. Security Concerns: Ensuring the security of our platform was paramount due to the sensitive financial data involved. We implemented best practices for secure coding, utilizing established libraries and frameworks for authentication and authorization, and established continuous monitoring and testing to mitigate potential risks.\n\n3. Allowance Management: Managing token allowances across different contracts posed a challenge, especially for users interacting with multiple tokens. We created a user-friendly interface that clearly communicates allowance requirements and guides users through setting them. Additionally, we provided educational resources to help users manage their allowances effectively.\n\n4. TypeScript Type Errors: We encountered various TypeScript type errors, particularly when integrating with smart contracts and managing data types. To overcome this, we enhanced our TypeScript definitions and leveraged type-safe libraries to ensure compatibility between our front-end and smart contract logic. By using stricter type annotations and thorough testing, we addressed these issues effectively.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThis project has been built during the Buildathon",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nAll my life I have been a citizen of India, and has been colsely observing the money management and and its development. and since the rise of UPI, I understand what effects, introduction of easy to use yet secure digital platform for money management can have on society.\n\nWhile I love the concept of UPI a lot, I also want something easy to use yet secure to be added to crypto ecosystem, and mojorrly in the ourr region, where scams and thefts are a daily thing. \n\nWhat if you are tavelling and lost your mobile phone, or cypto wallet. you might loose all your asset, One might say why would we travel with ourr crypto wallets, we will keep them safely locked in a locke, then how would you carrry out the required trransactions, we provide a solution to that.\n\nPlus BASED SEA hackathon allows focus on smart wallets, to allow normal web2 users to onboard web3 with passkeys, now with delegated accounts they nneed not worry about them being loosing their passkeys ever\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWhy isn't Crypto as mainstream as Centralized monetary systems? What are some major factors making people avoid using crypto for usual monetary transactions?\n\nOne such factor is the sense of security, One might feel safe with their money when it is locked some where safe, when you are confident that your money is somewhere safe.\nA monetary system becomes strong and preferred when it could allow you to have that sense of security and still be able to spend your money where ever you want.\n\nOne such solution banks came up was introduction of plastic money(credit and debit cards which now evolved into online payment systems), and now a person could bee safe about his money in the bank and carry the plastic money anywhere, in case the plastic money i.e. card or your mobile is stolen, one can easily call and disable the card and one will never loose anything other than a very small amount. Also now you could have multiple plastic cards which you could share with your family and allow them to spend from your account nd also set limits and restrictions on everything\n\nWith crypto the issue is, we always have to carry the account with us, be it a hardware wallet or in mobile. We needed something with crypto such that your highly secure hardware wallet could lie guilt free in a safe and you could carry out smaller transactions without any issue.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nDelegated Accounts and Cypto Plastic Money tries to provide similar ability(as mentioned in challenges section) for crypto accounts by providing a delegator contract for main account and allowing multiple delegates i.e. family members to spend from the main account,\n\nIt also provides full ability to restrict daily limits for amount and number of transactions as well as per transaction limit and time delay between two transaction, also allowing you to monitor who initiated the transactions.\n\nNext phase involves involvement of NFC transactions, and we are also working on a new type of NFC card based crypto delegated wallet to allow blockchain  and crypto to go mainstream\n\n**please note this is our first step towards creating actual plastic crypto in form of nfc card, We have the finalized the RTL designs for a IC , with NFC capabilities, and could sign wallet transactions on chip, and will be using delegator contracts. The chip is now in Verifications stages and we are reverifying the storage security capabilities for the same. we are in talk with a silicon proven edtech startup \"VSD\" in India to get our chips taped out, Our team was sponsored for a Complete internship by the startup to understand complete process related to IC design manufacturing, add now we re certified Physical Design Engineer.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe wanted to showcase the usefulness of delegated account to the community but were much busy with the Development and Testing of the IC design, and complete frontend for this project was built in only few days to be in mainstream community in this hackathon, while also making sure that we understand community and make necessary changes to the final expected product.\n\nWe first created a Delegator contract, could be found on our git repo contract's section in RemixIDE . and toughly tested out its capabilities.\n\nDelegator contract could be deployed by any main account who wants to add delegates.\nThen user would provide allowance to the Delegator contract to spend money on te accounts behalf, this could be restricted based on user's preference, and could add another security layer.\n\nThen user could add as many delegates as he wants and provide separate name and values of daily limits for amount and number of transactions as well as per transaction limit and time delay between two transaction.\n\nThese delegates could be an wallet based account without restrictions\n\nThen delegates could use our delegates sections to see their limits, and carry out transactions of sending USDT form the section, without requiring to have any available resources\n\nIf a delegate account is compromised or stolen or lost, one can directly login using main account and disable the delegate account, or can contact admin contract to get the delegate disabled.\n\nWe also made a Admin Contract to manage addresses of all delegate accounts, and allow disabling delegates without having access to main account in cases you are travelling, etc.\n\nWe also created a frontend for accessing the same using react and OnchainKit\n\n## Additional Features\n\nComplete project was ideated, designed and built in the Buildathon period, same poject with tronlink support was also submitted to tron hackathon which an parellel to the buildathon to utilize their energy sharing model,",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are intrigued with the Base mechanism. We are also quite interested in the various aspects of blockchain technology and Web 2.0, Web 3.0 and backend development.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nScanX addresses a growing concern in both education and professional settings: distinguishing AI-generated content from authentic human work. With the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and advanced image and video generators, it's increasingly difficult to verify whether written assignments, images, or videos are genuine. This presents challenges in maintaining academic integrity and authenticity in media. The solutions currently available in the market are all centralized platforms.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nScanX leverages cutting-edge machine learning models to accurately detect whether text, images, or videos are AI-generated or real, ensuring that both digital and written submissions are fair and trustworthy. Since it is also blockchain based, the profiles and all the data over their account is securely stored over Base. We have brought a decentralized platform using Base that enables the user identity to remain anonymous and all the work done on this site will also remain secure.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Since the models we used are quite large, we pushed the backend on GitHub and uploaded the models separately on a drive link. We tried to use the aws hosting services but its free tier is only for CPU, not for GPU. Since our project requires GPU, we had to host the backend locally on GitHub.\n\n2. The team members had to put in a lot of efforts to make the website resposive. There was a long process of acceptance and rejection of page design ideas before unanimously agreeing on the final designs.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nBlockchain Based Data Storage(IPFS)  using Pinata APIs.\nScanX leverages blockchain technology to enhance the security and integrity of user profiles by securely storing uploaded files\u2014be it videos, images, or texts\u2014along with their corresponding analyses as hashed data. This ensures that each user\u2019s information is protected against unauthorized access and tampering. By converting these files and analyses into hashes, ScanX maintains a permanent and immutable record on the blockchain, providing users with verifiable proof of their submissions and analyses. Additionally, all on-chain transactions are meticulously recorded, fostering transparency and trust in the system while enabling users to easily track and manage their interactions with the platform.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe\u2019re excited to be a part of Based India because we need smarter, safer tools for liquidity providers and traders alike. Which is why we created SmartSwap. By using Base's infrastructure, we are able to build highly innovative and intelligent Automated Market Maker (AMM) solution, SmartSwap empowers liquidity providers and traders both. This hackathon provides a great platform to contribute to the DeFi ecosystem in India and explore the technical advancements that Base enables for cross-chain solutions.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in DeFi, is dealing with losses during periods of high market volatility. We are addressing the challenge of liquidity provider (LP) losses during periods of elevated volatility. Traditional AMMs are static in nature and do not adapt to fluctuating market conditions, often leading to significant losses for LPs due to arbitrage and impermanent loss. These issues are particularly acute in volatile markets, where LPs face Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR) risk. This problem is not only common globally but also limits the appeal of DeFi in emerging markets like India, where users may need to be more aware of liquidity risks in decentralized exchanges.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nSmartSwap introduces AI/ML-powered dynamic fee mechanisms that adjust trading fees in real-time based on market volatility. This reduces LP exposure to arbitrageurs and LVR, protecting their assets during volatile market conditions. Our solution leverages Base's infrastructure to facilitate cross-chain communications, enabling a broader scope for liquidity management across EVM-compatible chains. With on-chain AI/ML inference on Base, SmartSwap can respond intelligently to market changes, providing liquidity providers with better risk management tools and a safer trading environment.Through SmartSwap, we aim to make decentralized finance safer for all participants, encouraging more users to become liquidity providers and helping DeFi ecosystems thrive.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the key technical challenges was ensuring seamless on-chain AI/ML inference, as running machine learning models directly on a blockchain requires significant optimization. We tackled this by using Base. Additionally, implementing cross-chain communication using CCIP to enable our volatility oracle to service other chains was a non-trivial task. We overcame these challenges by rigorously testing our cross-chain communication protocols and optimizing the model deployment and inference processes. Another hurdle was ensuring fair simulations to benchmark our dynamic fee model against traditional AMMs, which required developing a simulation program that accounts for market conditions and rational trading strategies.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nDuring the Hackathon, we focused on refining the cross-chain volatility oracle system, enabling other EVM-compatible chains to benefit from SmartSwap\u2019s dynamic fees. We also enhanced the on-chain simulation tool to ensure it could handle real-world market conditions across multiple chains",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\n-**Personal Experience with Paper Leaks**: I experienced the severe issue of paper leaks myself , which negatively impacted my exam and many others. The scale of this problem in India is massive, with 65 major paper leaks reported since 2019 (as per India Today).\n-**Desire to Solve a Critical National Problem**: Paper leaks undermine the trust in the education system and allow corruption to flourish. This hackathon offers an opportunity to use blockchain to address this deeply ingrained issue.\n-**Innovative Use of Blockchain**: Blockchain technology, particularly BASE for its low gas fees, can bring transparency, accountability, and fairness to exams, something India desperately needs.\n-**Contribution to a Trusted System**: By participating, I aim to build a solution that eliminates the current issues of manual exam processes, creating a secure and tamper-proof system that benefits students and institutions alike.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n-**Exam Paper Leaks**: A primary challenge is the frequent exam paper leaks, often caused by insecure printing processes, corruption and low trust in authorities. Students' futures are at risk when papers are leaked ahead of exams.\n-**Cheating and Malpractice**: There is rampant cheating during exams, enabled by corrupt officials, lenient examiners, and students using impersonators to take exams on their behalf.\n-**Untrustworthy Results**: Exam results become unreliable, as some students are unfairly given extra time or marks, while others have their answer sheets tampered with by examiners.\n-**High Costs for Secure Exam Conducting**: Traditional exam processes involve high logistical costs, including printing, distributing, and managing physical exam papers, which also increase the risk of security breaches.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\n- **Blockchain for Exam Security**: We are utilizing blockchain technology on BASE, known for its low gas fees, to create a secure, transparent, and immutable exam system. This eliminates the need for printed papers and ensures tamper-proof management of exams.\n- **Smart Contracts for Exam Management**:\n1.**Wallet-Based Registration**: Every student will register for their exams using a unique wallet address, ensuring that exam participation is tied to a verified individual.\n2.**AI Face Scanning for Identity Verification**: Students will be required to undergo AI face scanning both during registration and before the exam starts, ensuring the registered student is the one taking the exam. This prevents impersonation fraud.\n3.**Paper Upload and Locking**: Exam papers will be uploaded to the blockchain as a part of the smart contract process, with access locked until the scheduled exam date. No one, not even high authorities, will be able to alter the paper once uploaded.\n4.**Time-Controlled Access**: Only students with registered wallets can access the exam at the predetermined time and question paper, preventing early access or unauthorized changes.\n5.**Auto Submission**: Smart contracts will enforce exam end times, automatically submitting answers and preventing further tampering with completed exams.\n6.**On-Chain Answer Sheets and Results**: For exams with multiple-choice questions (MCQs), students' answers will be stored on the blockchain, ensuring no examiner or authority can alter the results after submission. This builds trust in the grading process.\nBy addressing these issues, we can make exam processes in India more secure, transparent, and trustworthy.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Late Participation in the Hackathon**\n-**Challenge**: Joining the Based India hackathon late restricted my time to create a working demo, which was essential for effectively presenting my project.\n-**Solution**: I concentrated on developing the project's core components and writing the basic code that could be tested on the blockchain. Additionally, I focused on clearly explaining the specific problems we aimed to solve and the potential outcomes. This approach allowed me to highlight the fundamental aspects of the solution, even without a complete demo.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nSolving real-life problems is, in my opinion, the best way to contribute to our country and humanity."

Public ledgers, like a guestbook, promote trust and transparency, which align with the open spirit of the SEA region. This project demonstrates how even simple blockchain applications can foster inclusiveness and accountability.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nTraditional online guestbooks and message boards are prone to tampering, censorship, or deletion of content. This limits free expression, especially in communities where digital censorship is an issue.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur decentralized guestbook ensures that all messages are publicly verifiable and immutable on the blockchain. Users can express their thoughts without fear of their messages being altered or removed. This builds trust within communities and demonstrates the value of censorship-resistant technology.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBlockchain Interaction:\nInitially, it was tricky to properly connect the frontend with the Base blockchain. We overcame this by using Ethers.js to simplify the communication between MetaMask and our contract.\nGas Fees on Base Goerli:\nSome users faced issues with testnet tokens. We solved this by guiding them to faucets where they could obtain Base testnet ETH.\nAsynchronous Frontend Logic:\nHandling the asynchronous nature of blockchain transactions in JavaScript required careful promise management. We used async/await syntax to keep the user experience smooth and responsive.\nThis project showcases how small but meaningful decentralized solutions can solve real-world challenges, empowering communities to be more open and accountable."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nOur team is really excited to participate in Based SEA because we\u2019re passionate about helping the Web3 space grow, especially in Southeast Asia. This region is quickly becoming a center for blockchain innovation, and we see huge potential to make a positive impact by working together with others.\n\nUsing Base, a secure and scalable Ethereum Layer 2, we\u2019re able to build decentralized applications that are faster and more cost-effective, making it easier to solve real-world problems. Base\u2019s technology gives us the tools we need to create efficient solutions, which is especially important in this evolving digital landscape.\n\nWe\u2019ve had the chance to attend various tech events and hackathons across Southeast Asia, which has allowed us to connect with the local tech community. Through these experiences, we\u2019ve gained a deep understanding of the opportunities here, and we\u2019re eager to bring innovative ideas to life using the power of Base. This hackathon is a great chance for us to collaborate, learn, and contribute to something meaningful for the region.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on a few key challenges in our community with the help of Base. One of the main challenges is making decentralized applications more accessible and efficient for users in Southeast Asia. High gas fees and slow transaction times can be major obstacles for people wanting to engage with blockchain technology, and Base helps solve this by offering a scalable Layer 2 solution with lower costs and faster transactions.\n\nAdditionally, we are addressing the lack of streamlined and user-friendly decentralized platforms that cater to local needs. By building on Base, we aim to create applications that are not only more affordable but also easier to use, making blockchain technology more accessible to everyday users.\n\nWe also see a challenge in the limited awareness and adoption of Web3 technologies in the region. By leveraging Base's secure and efficient infrastructure, we are working on projects that can help educate and onboard more users into the decentralized ecosystem, making blockchain technology a part of daily life in our community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project, Secure SignX, tackles the challenge of creating a decentralized, secure, and efficient system for managing document attestations and compliance. Industries that rely on extensive documentation and legal processes often face issues with delays, high costs, and the risk of tampering. Secure SignX addresses these problems head-on by offering a streamlined solution that enhances trust and transparency.\n\nProject Overview:\nSecure SignX integrates two key technologies:\n\n1. Sign Protocol: This protocol ensures that document attestations are stored securely on the blockchain. By deploying on the Base Sepolia Testnet, we provide a scalable and cost-effective solution. It guarantees that legal documents are tamper-proof and verifiable by all involved parties, improving the overall security and reliability of the attestation process.\n\n2. XMTP Protocol: This protocol powers real-time communication through automated notifications. Whenever a document is submitted, attested, or updated, relevant users like employees, compliance officers, and managers are immediately notified. This removes the need for manual follow-ups and ensures everyone stays informed without delays.\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Transparency & Trust: By decentralizing the document attestation process, we make it easier for stakeholders to trust the system. Every attestation is verifiable, making the process more transparent and reducing the need for third-party intermediaries.\n  \n- Improved Efficiency: Automated notifications through the XMTP Protocol and the MessageKit Bot streamline communication. This reduces the time spent on manual updates, improves collaboration, and speeds up compliance workflows.\n\nThis is designed to have a positive impact on industries that rely on strict compliance and document integrity, such as legal, HR, and corporate governance. By providing a decentralized, secure, and efficient way to manage attestations, we\u2019re making compliance processes faster, cheaper for everyone.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile working on Secure SignX, we encountered a few significant challenges, both technical and non-technical, that required creative problem-solving.\n\nIntegrating Sign Protocol with Base Sepolia Testnet: Initially, we had trouble deploying the attestation schema to the Base Sepolia Testnet. Managing the testnet's intricacies, including ensuring proper gas estimations and transaction efficiency, was tricky. To overcome this, we dove deeper into optimizing smart contracts and used more precise gas limits, which resolved most deployment issues.\n\nReal-time Notification System: Building a seamless notification system with XMTP Protocol was another challenge. We had to ensure that notifications were sent to the right users at the right time without delay. Initially, there were issues with notification lag and routing errors. We solved this by tweaking the message flow and implementing better event-driven triggers, ensuring that everyone received instant updates.\n\nUser Roles and Permissions: Defining and managing user roles (Compliance Officer, Manager, Submitter) within the system was complex. It was essential that only authorized individuals could take certain actions, like attesting documents or reviewing them. We overcame this by implementing strict role-based access controls and running multiple rounds of testing to ensure the correct permissions were enforced at all times.\n\nUser Experience: Making the platform easy to use, especially for non-technical users, was another hurdle. Initially, the user flow felt a bit too technical. To fix this, we simplified the UI/UX design, making it more intuitive, while ensuring that the underlying functionality remained robust.\n\nThese challenges pushed us to adapt and improve, ultimately leading to a more efficient and user-friendly product.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWhile Secure SignX had its foundational components in place before the Buildathon, we took the opportunity to enhance the project significantly during this event. Here\u2019s what we added:\n\nIntegration with Base Sepolia Testnet: Prior to the Buildathon, we hadn\u2019t integrated our attestation schema with the Base Sepolia Testnet. This integration allowed us to bring the attestations on-chain, making the system more decentralized and secure. We spent considerable time ensuring smooth deployment and transaction efficiency on this testnet during the event.\n\nReal-time Notifications via XMTP: The XMTP Protocol integration was another key feature added during the Buildathon. By implementing this, we enabled automatic, real-time notifications to be sent to employees, compliance officers, and managers based on document submissions and attestations. This feature streamlined communication and improved user engagement.\n\nMessageKit Compliance Bot: We introduced the Compliance Bot using MessageKit during the Buildathon. The bot assists users based on their roles (Manager, Compliance Officer, Submitter) by providing relevant updates and interactions. This automation ensures that users get guided support throughout the attestation process.\n\nUser Role Management: We implemented more sophisticated role-based access controls, ensuring that only authorized users could perform certain actions, such as document attestation or review. This feature was refined and tested extensively during the Buildathon to enhance security and usability.\n\nThese additions have greatly improved the functionality and user experience of Secure SignX, making it a more complete and efficient platform.",

No-code tools bridge this gap by allowing non-technical users to easily create and deploy social frames without the need for programming knowledge, significantly reducing development costs. This also speeds up the time to market, empowering users to experiment, innovate, and actively participate in the Web3 ecosystem, making digital innovation more accessible to a broader audience in India.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nA no-code frame-building tool for Farcaster addresses key challenges faced by Indian users, particularly the lack of technical expertise and high development costs. Many entrepreneurs, creators, and small businesses in India have innovative ideas but lack the coding skills or resources to build decentralized applications on Web3 platforms like Farcaster. No-code tools bridge this gap by allowing non-technical users to easily create and deploy social frames without the need for programming knowledge, significantly reducing development costs. This also speeds up the time to market, empowering users to experiment, innovate, and actively participate in the Web3 ecosystem, making digital innovation more accessible to a broader audience in India.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThere are very less tools for creating farcaster frames and customise those frames as per the user's requirement. We have created a no code tool for anyone to create farcaster frames along with customising buttons, post actions, images, text etc. They can also track the clicks on their frames and see detailed analysis \n\nBuilding a no-code tool for creating Farcaster frames can have a significant impact on users in India by democratizing access to Web3 development and fostering digital innovation across a diverse set of creators, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. India has a rapidly growing tech-savvy population, but not everyone has the technical expertise to build decentralized applications or harness the full potential of blockchain technologies. With a no-code tool, users from all backgrounds\u2014including those in small towns or rural areas\u2014can participate in the growing decentralized ecosystem without needing advanced programming skills. This allows them to build social apps, integrate blockchain-based identities, or create community-driven platforms tailored to local needs and contexts, thus empowering them to develop Web3 solutions that can address issues like financial inclusion, social connectivity, or community-driven projects. By simplifying the development process and reducing costs, no-code tools can help Indian users unleash their creativity and entrepreneurial potential, while contributing to the global shift toward decentralized applications. We have integrated UPI payments for anyone to pay on frames without having to have crypto and yet do txns on chain gaslessly with the help Base paymaster\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIntegrating base paymaster into our dapp. But we were successful finally\n\n## Additional Features\n\nTransaction Frames, customisable frames, additional frame templates. etc",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n## The Problem: Groupthink, Predictability, and Herd Behavior in Polling & Prediction Markets\nMost social polls and prediction platforms reward majority consensus, encouraging users to vote with the crowd. This system often reinforces herd mentality and suppresses contrarian or original thinking. As a result, outcomes become predictable, surface-level, and lack the nuance required to truly understand diverse public sentiment. In a time where echo chambers dominate and true opinions are often filtered, there's a growing need for a platform that values divergence over conformity.\n## How \u201cNot Your Type\u201d Solves It\nNot Your Type is a Web3-powered prediction market and social polling platform that turns traditional logic on its head: users are rewarded not for being popular, but for being unpredictable. It introduces a new kind of incentive model\u2014where choosing the least voted option earns the highest rewards. This gamifies contrarian thinking and encourages users to challenge mainstream narratives.\n- **Reverses incentive structure:** Rewards users for minority picks instead of majority consensus\n- **Unlocks contrarian insights:** Surfaces perspectives that are often overlooked or undervalued\n- **Gamifies individuality:** Makes independent thinking fun, measurable, and rewarding\n- **Real-time feedback loop:** Users can see evolving trends and adjust their strategies live\n- **Powered by Web3 wallets:** Uses thirdweb for seamless wallet integration and on-chain rewards\n- **Accessible UI:** Built with Radix UI and Tailwind for a sleek, inclusive user experience\n## Why It Matters\nBy flipping the polling model, Not Your Type enables a new form of sentiment mapping\u2014one that captures outlier behavior, emerging trends, and honest expression. In an era defined by algorithms and echo chambers, this platform gives voice to the unexpected. It's not just a tool for voting\u2014it's a playground for ideas that don\u2019t fit the mold.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest technical challenges we encountered was writing a smart contract in Solidity that could support the unique mechanics of Not Your Type including dynamic poll creation, real-time vote handling, and reward distribution for least popular choices. Achieving this while maintaining scalability, modularity, and security proved to be a complex task. We had to carefully structure the contract logic to minimize gas costs and avoid vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a game-theoretic environment. Ensuring fairness in reward logic without revealing too much on-chain was particularly tricky, and required multiple iterations and audits of our contract design.\nDuring deployment, we faced several roadblocks. Initial attempts to deploy manually led to contract size errors and configuration mismatches across different EVM-compatible networks. These issues disrupted our development flow and made it harder to test end-to-end functionality. To streamline this process, we adopted thirdweb\u2019s contract deployment tooling, which significantly reduced friction and gave us more control and visibility into deployments. It allowed us to version, manage, and redeploy contracts efficiently across testnets and mainnet environments without diving deep into manual deployment scripts.\nEven after successful deployment, integrating the contract into the frontend presented another set of challenges. Syncing on-chain data with the client in real-time, handling wallet interactions, and managing transaction states made the frontend logic more complex than expected. We resolved this by using thirdweb\u2019s React SDK, which abstracted much of the contract interaction layer and provided hooks and utilities for clean integration. This not only sped up development but also ensured a seamless experience for users\u2014from connecting their wallet to casting votes and claiming rewards\u2014all powered by a solid, scalable contract infrastructure.",

Task scheduling and monitoring complexity \nOne of our most significant challenges was implementing reliable task scheduling to ensure comprehensive system monitoring. We needed a robust mechanism to track and execute scheduled tasks without omissions, which was critical for maintaining consistent monitoring across all handled platforms. We addressed this by implementing a centralized task management system with redundancy checks to verify successful execution.\n\n2. Deployment environment dependencies \nWe faced considerable difficulty getting FFmpeg pre-installed on our deployment service, which was essential for our media processing requirements. This required creating a custom Nixpacks configuration to ensure FFmpeg was properly integrated into our deployment pipeline. The solution demanded deep understanding of both our deployment environment and FFmpeg's dependencies.\n\n3. Platform isolation and system resilience rarly in development\nwe identified a critical vulnerability: if one platform's integration failed, it could potentially crash our entire backend system. To resolve this, we redesigned our architecture to use a microservices approach, where each platform's backend operated as a separate, isolated service. This architectural decision significantly improved our system's fault tolerance and stability, allowing individual platform issues to be contained without affecting the broader system.\n\n4.

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nEveryone on social media is stuck in the doomscrolling loop. They are not able to find the content that is relevant and provide value to them.\n\n## Why does this problem exist?\n\nLack of personalization and context in the content that is being consumed.\n\n## What are the possible solutions to this problem?\n\nThe generic solution to this is to ask user to define their interests and preferences, and then based on that, the content is personalized.\n\nBut this is not a good or scalable solution. No one has time to define their interests or select the option to \"Not Interested\".\n\n# Solution: Realm\n\n[Realm](https://realm.megabyte0x.xyz) is the AI powered infra for providing personalized experience to users on any social media platform.\n\n## How does Realm solve the problem?\n\nRealm uses AI intelligence to understand users' post and its intent, and create a rich contextual graph for every user.\nThis contextual graph can be utilized by any social media application to provide personalized content to their users.\n\n## Implementations\n\nWe have created two implementations to showcase the power of personalized social graph created by Realm.\n\n### ReplyGuy\n\nReplyGuy is a simple agent, powered by Realm, which comments on your posts on Farcaster with other relevant posts as per the content you mentioned.\nWe got **360+ users** within a week of launch and served 16K+ replies.\n\n[Demo](https://youtu.be/wY07-IEqBNc) || [Live Link](https://replyguy.megabyte0x.xyz) || [Source Code](https://github.com/Hojaeaga/replyguy)\n\n### FarSearch\n\nFarSearch is a ChatGPT like interface, powered by Realm, which can be used to search any content on Farcaster.\n\n[Live Link](https://farsearch.megabyte0x.xyz)\n\n# How does Realm work?\n\nRealm fetches real-time content on Farcaster and analyzes the content to create a personalized graph for the user.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n1. Neynar APIs for fetching content from Farcaster.\n2. Eigen Layer AVS on Base and Ethereum.\n3. Gemini and OpenAI for generating embeddings.\n4. Supabase for storing the data.\n\n## Contracts\n\nThe following AVS contracts have been deployed on Base Sepolia (L2) and Ethereum Holesky (L1):\n- [AVS_GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xF008031601847dCDe95904bB94e1F0D9804E0e4b)\n- [ATTESTATION_CENTER_ADDRESS](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x87d95ad1730ebaeed5a8a563ce69febd7e14220a)\n\n## NOTE\n\n- We have deployed AVS on the *Base Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia testnet*, due to the cost and setup of the reward distribution mechanism for validators.\n- The only open source repo is for ReplyGuy: https://github.com/Hojaeaga/replyguy\n- If you like to access any of the private repos, please reach out to us at Telegram [@megabyte0x](https://t.me/megabyte0x) or [megabyte0x@gmail.com](mailto:megabyte0x@gmail.com).\n\n# Roadmap\n\nWe have big vision for Realm. Currently, we are using Farcaster social graph but working on to expand to other social media platforms like Telegram, X, and more.\n\nThe cross-platform social graph will be a game changer and will help us to provide the best personalized experience to users on any social media platform.\n\n# What are we looking for?\n\nWe are actively raising funds to build the scalable and robust infrastructure for Realm.\n\n# Contact Us\n\nIf you have any questions or want to discuss the project, feel free to reach out to us at Telegram [@megabyte0x](https://t.me/megabyte0x) or [megabyte0x@gmail.com](mailto:megabyte0x@gmail.com).\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAfter building the base infra (Realm), we launched an application on top of it, ReplyGuy, a simple agent which comments on your posts with the other relevant posts as per the content mentioned.\n\nIn starting, we were happy with the responses from the AI and in getting our first 120 Subscribers.\n\nLink: https://warpcast.com/yourreplyguy/0xa9cfb518\n\nBut when we looked for the feedback from the users, we found two major issues:\n\nThe reply frequency was really high.\nSometimes the reply was not relevant to the post.\nSo we sat, screamed through the night and came up with the following solution:\n\nConditional reply based on the post.\n\nExamples:\n\nIf the post is just a reply to some other post or any empty quote post, then don't reply.\nIf the post is in a channel, prioritise the content discovery from the channel.\nAnother issue was verifying that the data is being fetched from the trusted servers and replies are being generated by the AI and doesn't have any human intervention.\n\nTo fix this, we came up with the following solution:\n\nVerifiable Agent using Eigen Layer.\n\nWe built an Eigen Layer AVS on Base and Ethereum to verify the data and the replies posted by the agent, using Reclaim Protocol and Othentic stack.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**The Problem:  Barriers to DeFi Adoption**\n\nDeFi\u2019s promise of high yields and financial autonomy is hindered by significant challenges that deter mainstream adoption. Research suggests that only a small fraction of cryptocurrency users engage with DeFi platforms due to the following barriers:\n\n**Technical Knowledge Gap:** DeFi requires users to evaluate smart contract security to avoid exploits, a task requiring expertise beyond most users\u2019 capabilities. \n\n**Complex Financial Concepts:** Terms like impermanent loss, liquidity mining, and yield,staking,LST are unfamiliar to non-experts.\n\n**Gas Fee Management:** High transaction costs on blockchains like Ethereum, especially during network congestion, demand strategic timing and optimization skills. \n\n**Cross-Chain Navigation:** As DeFi expands across multiple blockchains, users needs to invest assets at different blockchains just for yields, and the challenge of using cross-chain bridges to move assets. \n\n**Rapid Protocol Evolution:** DeFi protocols frequently upgrade, introducing new features and mechanisms. \n\nThese barriers make DeFi inaccessible to billions of potential users, such as teachers, doctors, or small business owners, leaving their assets idle in wallets. Industry reports indicate that 78% of crypto owners cite complexity as the primary obstacle to DeFi engagement, highlighting a significant untapped market opportunity.\n\n**A$CE\u2019s Solution: Simplifying DeFi**\n\nA$CE tackles these challenges by offering a platform that abstracts DeFi\u2019s complexities, delivering a seamless, secure, and efficient experience. \n\n**Protocol-Agnostic Yield Generation:** A$CE enables users to deposit assets into a pool, where an AI-driven system which runs on mathematically advanced algorithms automatically routes them to the most profitable yield sources across DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Aave and others . This eliminates the need for users to research or select protocols manually, addressing the technical knowledge gap.\n\n**Institutional-Grade Security:** A$CE rigorously verifies all integrated protocols to meet high security standards, reducing the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities. This builds user confidence and mitigates concerns about protocol safety, a major barrier to adoption.\n\n**Web2-Like Interface:** By mimicking the simplicity of traditional web interfaces, A$CE removes blockchain-specific terminology and processes. This intuitive design makes DeFi accessible to users with no technical background, overcoming the complexity of financial concepts.\n\n**Multi-Asset Pool Efficiency:** A$CE aggregates user deposits to optimize gas fees, making transactions cost-effective. This pooling also allows smaller deposits to participate in yield-generating activities, broadening access to DeFi and addressing gas fee management challenges.\n\n**24/7 Automated Market Intelligence:** A$CE employs advanced algorithms that continuously monitor the DeFi ecosystem, adjusting asset allocations to maximize returns. These algorithms are mathematically sound, drawing from quantitative trading strategies used in crypto markets, similar to those in crypto quant trading, ensuring optimal performance across evolving protocols.\n\n**Future AI Personalization:** A$CE plans to introduce personalized AI agents that learn individual risk preferences and financial goals, creating tailored investment strategies. This feature, akin to services offered to high-net-worth clients, will enhance user engagement and address diverse financial needs.\n\nThese features collectively transform DeFi into a one-click experience, aligning with the needs of mainstream users who seek simplicity, security, and reliability. By leveraging mathematically sound algorithms, A$CE ensures that yield generation is both efficient and robust, further enhancing its appeal.\n\n**These are the pool that we support:**\n**Low Risk Pool**\nA conservative approach focusing on well-established pools with proven stability, high TVL (Total Value Locked), and consistent fee generation.\n\n**Medium Risk Pool**\nA balanced approach that achieves moderate risk and return. Targets pools with good trading volume and reasonable APR while maintaining acceptable volatility levels.\n\n**High Risk Pool**\nAn aggressive approach targeting maximum APR that accepts higher volatility. Focuses on newer or more volatile pools with potential for significantly higher returns.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n**No Company building experience:** If selected for the Network School Fellowship, we'll leverage this opportunity to transform A$CE from a promising product into a unicorn. Our team brings strong technical skills and a deep understanding of DeFi's challenges, but we recognize our knowledge gap in company building and go-to-market strategy.\nOther Challenges: \nThis project definitely had its challenges! Time was the biggest constraint - balancing all the features we wanted against the hackathon deadline and a full-time job was tough.\n\nI planned to implement EIP 7702 to streamline the user experience and eliminate repetitive transaction approvals, but had to prioritize core functionality first. Similarly, while I focused on making the contracts work correctly, I couldn't spend as much time on security auditing as I'd have liked.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n\ud83e\udde9 The Problem It Solves\nTraditional dungeon-crawler games are fun and immersive, but they often lack ownership, progressive incentives, and long-term value for players. Once the game ends, your efforts and progress vanish \u2014 and there's no meaningful way to monetize or carry forward your success.\n\nDarkest Dungeon changes that paradigm by merging procedural gameplay with on-chain value creation. Here's how we solve existing gaps:\n\n\ud83c\udfae 1. Lack of Player Ownership in Traditional Games\nMost games store progress off-chain and tie it to centralized systems. In Darkest Dungeon, your score, loot, and achievements can be minted on-chain, giving players true ownership of their in-game success.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 2. No Real Incentives in Roguelikes\nWhile roguelikes are engaging, they don't offer real-world rewards for high performance. We introduce Dungeon Tokens ($DGN), an ERC-20 token you can mint based on your in-game performance \u2014 giving financial incentives to skilled players and enhancing replayability.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f 3. Disconnected Gameplay and Web3\nMany Web3 games either focus too much on blockchain without good gameplay or have great gameplay with poor Web3 integration. Darkest Dungeon balances both by using Web3 only where it adds real value \u2014 such as:\n\nSaving top scores on-chain,\n\nRewarding consistent progress,\n\nUnlocking in-game perks based on on-chain history.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f 4. Static Experiences in Indie Games\nReplayability is a challenge. Our procedural dungeon generation ensures no two runs are the same, keeping players engaged through unpredictability, challenge scaling, and randomized loot/enemies.\n\n\ncontract address\nDeploying contracts using deployer address: 0x6Fd50cdB870061aAa07edD2b91b77FB148D0c686\n  Deployed Dungeon Token at address: 0x915450637EAB35Cb6D8F6538631120aE7145d902\n  Deployed Darkest Dungeon at address: 0x99d24B28241596843948952c59a8746030CC3547\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding Darkest Dungeon presented several exciting but tough challenges. Here's how we tackled them:\n\n\ud83e\uddf1 1. On-Chain Integration Without Compromising Gameplay\nChallenge: Integrating smart contracts without disrupting the Base gameplay loop was tricky. We wanted Web3 to feel like a bonus, not a barrier.\n\nSolution: We decoupled gameplay from blockchain actions. Core mechanics run client-side, while score submission and token minting happen after the run, making the Web3 experience smooth and optional for casual players.\n\n\ud83e\uddea 2. Procedural Dungeon Generation\nChallenge: Creating a dungeon that\u2019s both random and playable (e.g., guaranteed path to stairs, fair enemy distribution) required careful balancing.\n\nSolution: We developed a custom algorithm to generate rooms with path validation logic, ensuring progression without making maps too predictable or too punishing.\n\n\ud83d\udd10 3. Smart Contract Testing & Security\nChallenge: Making sure scores couldn\u2019t be spoofed or manipulated when minting tokens.\n\nSolution: We implemented basic score verification rules (e.g., timers, thresholds) and used testnets like BaseTestnet to simulate edge cases. We also scoped further protection for future versions, such as server-side validators or ZK-based proofs of score integrity.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 4. Gas Efficiency for Score Minting\nChallenge: Storing every score detail on-chain was too gas-intensive.\n\nSolution: We optimized by storing only essential metadata (e.g., final score, timestamp, player address) and pushing other data to off-chain storage (like IPFS, for future updates).\n\n\ud83e\uddf0 5. Tooling Across a Monorepo\nChallenge: Managing a Turborepo with multiple apps (apps/web, smart contracts, shared assets) led to compatibility issues with tools like Vite, Foundry, and RainbowKit.\n\nSolution: We modularized the repo using consistent pnpm workspaces and synced environment variables across layers. Careful dependency management helped us avoid version mismatches and build errors.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 6. Wallet UX for Testnets\nChallenge: Some users had trouble interacting with Base Testnet wallets due to network setup and lack of faucet availability.\n\nSolution: We provided a guided UI for connecting wallets and added fallback logic for unsupported networks. We also manually funded testers with testnet BaseEth to streamline their experience.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThis project touches different aspects of these listed problems in one way or other\n\nOne of the most important problem Kuri can solve is for people from emerging markets with high inflation rates where holding onto their native currencies is as bad as aping into a top blasted shit coin, where the chart is going down always, Kuri helps all these people to save along with their friends or family in fun and gamified manner using USD pegged stable coins, this way they could hedge against inflation to a great extend.\n\nThere are lot of frictions for capital access especially for micro loans using platforms like Kiva, and with the traditional finance there is always gonna be geo-restrictions either due to liquidity access or regulatory side, but this approach solves for all of this and as the stable coin adoption increases this is gonna help a lot of people who had very less access to traditional finance and capitals.\n\nSome of the other problems I think this or a derivative of this can be used in solving the following problems:\n\nPredatory Lending Escape: Eliminates high-cost microloans by offering a fair, time-bound system where everyone contributes and gets a turn \u2014 no one pays more than they put in.\n\nStructured Savings Discipline: Builds consistency in saving habits by introducing time-locked deposits, social accountability, and the emotional pull of a raffle-based reward.\n\nOn-Chain Trust & Transparency: Brings ROSCAs on-chain with full auditability, programmable fairness, and immutable smart contracts, removing informal system risks like fraud or mismanagement.\n\nSocial Finance Reinvigorated: Uses social trust, peer selection, and community coordination to power financial systems \u2014 replacing anonymous yield farms with meaningful, human-centered financial experiences.\n\nAccessible, Intuitive UX: Strips away DeFi complexity by grounding the product in familiar concepts like saving circles, raffles, and group goals, with a fun and refined interface.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSo one main challenge that I can think of is in integrating the chainlink vrf and making the subscription dynamic, so that every contract is being added as a consumer to one of the vrf subscriptions, I had to hop on their discord support a couple of times and later on figured out from their contracts.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nHookTuah is an innovative Uniswap V4 hook that enables single-sided liquidity provision with Just-In-Time (JIT) rebalancing, designed to make liquidity provision more accessible and capital-efficient for DeFi users. Traditionally, providing liquidity on automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap requires users to supply both tokens of a trading pair in precise ratios. This can be a barrier for users who only hold one asset, and exposes them to impermanent loss and inefficient capital usage.\n\nHookTuah addresses this by allowing users to deposit just one token (either Token0 or Token1) into a Uniswap V4 pool. The hook acts as a smart counterparty, automatically rebalancing and providing the other side of the pair as needed. During swaps, HookTuah can perform JIT rebalancing, dynamically adjusting its position to reduce impermanent loss and improve liquidity efficiency. This approach lowers the entry barrier for liquidity providers, enables more flexible capital deployment, and enhances overall pool liquidity.\n\n\n### How It Works\n\n- Single-Sided Deposits: Users deposit either token0 or token1. The hook tracks user balances and manages the pool\u2019s net position.\n- JIT (Just-In-Time) Rebalancing: During swaps or significant price movements, the hook automatically rebalances its liquidity, reducing impermanent loss and improving capital efficiency.\n- Automated Management: The hook monitors pool prices and liquidity, adjusting its strategy in real time for optimal performance.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n- Lower Barrier to Entry: Users no longer need to hold or acquire both tokens, making DeFi more accessible.\n- Reduced Risk: Automated rebalancing helps protect against impermanent loss, a major concern for LPs.\n- Protocol Efficiency: By acting as a smart counterparty, HookTuah can help pools maintain tighter spreads and deeper liquidity.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Accurate Accounting:\nEnsuring accurate tracking of user balances, net deltas, and hook-owned liquidity required careful design and extensive testing. Also taking care of edge cases, such as simultaneous deposits/withdrawals and rapid price changes, were handled by implementing robust internal accounting.\n\n## Integration with Uniswap v4:\nAdapting the hook to work seamlessly with Uniswap v4\u2019s pool manager and callback system required a deep understanding of the unidwap math.\n\n## Gas Efficiency:\nMaintaining gas efficiency while providing advanced features like JIT rebalancing and single-sided provision was challenging. Optimizations included minimizing state writes, using efficient data structures, and leveraging Solidity libraries.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nAuditHook tackles the critical need for robust and specialized security auditing in the rapidly evolving DeFi space, specifically within the Base ecosystem and with a deep understanding of Uniswap v4 hooks.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it addresses needs and improves existing solutions:\n\nAddressing Needs:\n\nGrowing Complexity of DeFi: DeFi protocols are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with innovations like Uniswap v4 hooks introducing new levels of customization and potential complexity. This increased complexity inherently creates more surface area for vulnerabilities that traditional auditing methods might miss or not fully grasp. AuditHook's specialized focus on Base and Uniswap v4 directly addresses this gap.\n\nEcosystem-Specific Security: Security considerations can vary across different blockchain ecosystems. AuditHook's optimization for the Base network ensures that its analysis is tailored to the specific nuances and potential risks prevalent within the Base environment.\n\nUniswap v4 Hook Vulnerabilities: Uniswap v4 hooks are a novel feature, and developers are still exploring their full potential. This novelty also means that established auditing tools might not have specific expertise or checks designed for the unique security challenges introduced by custom hook logic. AuditHook directly addresses this by building in awareness and specific analysis for these hooks.\n\nAccessibility and Developer Education: Security auditing can often be expensive and time-consuming, potentially hindering smaller teams or individual developers. AuditHook aims to provide a more accessible solution with its user-friendly interface and educational resources, empowering developers to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.\n\nThe Need for AI-Enhanced Analysis: Traditional static analysis tools can identify known patterns of vulnerabilities, but they might struggle with novel or more subtle exploits. Integrating AI, like Google's Gemini, allows AuditHook to leverage pattern recognition and potentially identify more complex and nuanced security risks.\n\nGas Optimization as a Security Consideration: Inefficient smart contracts can be more expensive to operate and might even introduce security risks in certain scenarios (e.g., gas exhaustion attacks). AuditHook's gas optimization detection helps developers write more efficient and potentially more secure code.\nImproving Existing Solutions:\n\nSpecialized Focus: Unlike generic smart contract auditors, AuditHook offers a targeted approach optimized for the Base network and with specific intelligence regarding Uniswap v4 hooks. This specialization allows for more in-depth and relevant analysis.\n\nAI Integration for Deeper Analysis: By incorporating AI, AuditHook goes beyond traditional static analysis, potentially identifying vulnerabilities that might be missed by less advanced tools.\nIntegrated Educational Resources: AuditHook doesn't just point out problems; it aims to educate developers by providing context, best practices, and links to relevant documentation, fostering a more security-conscious development community on Base.\n\nUser-Friendly Design: The platform's focus on a clean and interactive user interface makes security auditing more accessible to a wider range of developers, regardless of their security expertise.\n\nEarly and Continuous Auditing: By offering a potentially more cost-effective and user-friendly solution, AuditHook encourages developers to integrate security auditing earlier and more frequently in their development process, rather than treating it as a late-stage gatekeeper.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of AuditHook, we encountered several notable obstacles that tested our technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Here's a look at some of them and how we navigated through these challenges:\n\n1. Integrating AI (Google's Gemini) for Smart Contract Analysis:\n\nChallenge: Effectively leveraging the Gemini AI API to understand and identify complex smart contract vulnerabilities proved to be a significant hurdle. Initial outputs from the AI sometimes lacked the specificity and actionable insights we aimed for. Training the AI or prompting it in a way that yielded accurate and relevant security findings required extensive experimentation and fine-tuning of the prompts.\n\nOvercoming: We iteratively refined our prompting strategies, providing the AI with more context about common Solidity vulnerabilities, secure coding best practices, and the specific nuances of the Base and Uniswap v4 environments. We also implemented a post-processing layer to interpret and structure the AI's output into a user-friendly format with clear recommendations and severity ratings. This involved carefully mapping AI-identified patterns to known vulnerability categories.\n\n2. Developing Specialized Analysis for Uniswap v4 Hooks:\n\nChallenge: Uniswap v4 hooks are a relatively new concept, and comprehensive documentation and established best practices were still evolving during our development. Building an analysis module that could effectively identify potential risks and inefficiencies unique to hook implementations required deep diving into the Uniswap v4 codebase and understanding the various lifecycle hooks and their potential interactions.\n\nOvercoming: Our team dedicated significant time to studying the Uniswap v4 documentation and example hook implementations. We built a set of custom static analysis rules specifically targeting common pitfalls in hook development, such as incorrect state management within hooks, potential reentrancy issues arising from external calls within hooks, and gas optimization opportunities unique to hook execution. We also created synthetic Uniswap v4 pool scenarios to test our analysis logic.\n\n3. Ensuring Accurate and Efficient Onchain Interactions with OnchainKit:\n\nChallenge: Interacting with the Base mainnet and retrieving relevant blockchain data for analysis and user feedback required a solid understanding of OnchainKit. We faced challenges in efficiently fetching contract bytecode, transaction data, and potentially relevant state variables. Ensuring these interactions were performant and didn't introduce latency into the analysis process was crucial for a good user experience.\n\nOvercoming: We optimized our data fetching strategies using OnchainKit's provided utilities and explored asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the main application thread. We also implemented caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce redundant calls to the blockchain. Thorough testing on the Base testnet helped us identify and resolve potential issues related to network connectivity and data consistency.\n\n4. Designing a User-Friendly Interface for Complex Audit Results:\n\nChallenge: Presenting complex security audit findings, gas optimization suggestions, and AI-generated insights in a clear, concise, and actionable manner was a design challenge. We wanted to avoid overwhelming users with technical jargon and instead provide them with understandable explanations and clear next steps.\n\nOvercoming: We adopted a user-centered design approach, iterating on the UI based on feedback and usability principles. We utilized the Shadcn UI component library to create a visually appealing and well-structured interface. We employed clear labeling, severity indicators, code snippets with highlighted issues, and expandable sections for detailed explanations and recommendations. The \"Export Report\" and \"Share\" functionalities were also prioritized to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n5. Balancing Feature Development with Buildathon Timeline:\n\nChallenge: The buildathon's time constraints required us to prioritize key features and make strategic decisions about what could be realistically implemented within the given timeframe. We had many ambitious ideas, but we needed to focus on delivering a core, functional product that showcased the unique value proposition of AuditHook.\n\nOvercoming: We adopted an agile development methodology with short sprints and regular team communication. We identified the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that would demonstrate the core AI-powered analysis and Uniswap v4 hook integration. We made conscious decisions to defer less critical features for future iterations, ensuring we had a polished and functional submission for the buildathon.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nCloud computing and GPU-based computing are heavily centralized, often controlled by a few large corporations, leading to expensive and restricted access for developers, researchers, and startups. With AI models requiring massive computing power, there's a rising demand for scalable, affordable, and censorship-resistant compute resources.\n\nHive addresses this by creating a decentralized GPU-sharing platform. It enables individuals to contribute their idle GPU power to a global network and allows users to rent this power for AI, rendering, or other intensive tasks. Using blockchain ensures transparent usage, fair rewards, and trustless coordination between GPU providers and users.\n\nThis democratizes access to computing resources, lowers costs, and reduces reliance on centralized cloud giants.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart contract design for trustless payment: Designing an incentive system that fairly rewards GPU providers without centralized arbitration was tricky. We implemented a reputation + escrow-based system for trust.\n\nVerification of real GPU contributions: Ensuring that shared resources are actually being used as promised was a technical challenge. We explored off-chain monitoring and cryptographic proof-of-work validation methods.\n\nDecentralized matchmaking system: Matching GPU supply and demand in a distributed network required designing a light yet efficient peer-to-peer protocol.\n\nUser onboarding complexity: Web3 interfaces and wallet integration are still confusing for new users. We added a guided onboarding UI and used libraries like Web3Modal to simplify wallet connection.\n\nDeployment scalability: Testing real-time workloads on a decentralized GPU network needed containerization and monitoring. We used Docker and Grafana for performance testing and feedback.",

Today, there's no safe or trusted platform where these non-developers can showcase, protect, and sell their ideas without the fear of them being stolen or misused.\n\nSolution- Idea Marketplace empowers ideators by giving them a secure platform to list, protect, and sell their startup/project ideas using blockchain. Buyers get to preview titles, but full access is unlocked only after payment \u2014 ensuring both trust and fair compensation.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nMaking content private until payment was tough-\nInitially, all idea details were showing up even without a purchase. It took some time to figure out how to gate the content properly using smart contracts and conditionally render it only for the buyer.\nDeploying on Base Sepolia wasn\u2019t smooth at first-\nSetting up the RPC, getting test ETH, and fixing config issues \u2014 it looked easy on paper but took hours of trial and error to finally deploy successfully.\nKeeping it simple for non-technical users-\nSince the platform is meant for people who just have ideas, not necessarily coding skills, I had to make sure the UI was clean, minimal, and didn\u2019t overwhelm anyone with techy stuff.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI was looking to sell one of my digital product \"How to post Banger on Reddit\". I listed on the web2 platforms but I didn't saw any way to sell it to the web3 frens and get paid in crypto. Plus I like like basename so I wanted to showcase my product on my basename and Frame would be a good way to do so.\n\nTherefore to solve my own problem I created a platform to sell digital products within 1 click as a Frame. To build this product I needed some motivation and momentum (I am a master procrastinator) therefore I joined this hackathon.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n\"Its easier to build then Sell\" \n\nI'm addressing the critical selling and exploration issue faced by small-time creators and builders across India\n\nCreators face Challenge to sell out their product. There is a whole graveyard of products which never see a ray of Sunlight. \nPlus Creators gets paid a lot less When Adding their product to a marketplace like Gumroad. \n\nThese Are the challenges I am focusing on\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nIts more likely to sell products on social media. Therefore Creating something that will pop in your audience feed is more important. \n\nOn Supamarket, creator will list their Products and share the Link to it on warpcast and other Frame Supported farcaster clients. It will pop up as a Frame which a user can buy directly from the frame (thanks to transactional frames) itself. And will receive the digital product as a Direct Cast. \n\nThis is boost creators product impression and Farcaster being a protocol more clients will show the product. And more chances of Creator selling their product to its audience. \n\nAlso creator can pin its product Frame on basenames and promote the product. \n\nOverall its an attempt to increase the onchain economy.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nI am new to Frames development. but its a cool feature. Therefore I was not familiar with the related libraries to build frames. \nTried multiple libraries including framesjs, frog but at last I started to understand the Onchainkit from coinbase and built frame using that. \n\nAnother Challenge I ran into was I wanted to secure the users Product Files. Read a lot about it and found out about Cloudflare r2 Presigned URL. \nSo which is basically when the user uploads their files/vides/pdfs to sell they will be stored in the Cloudflare r2 private bucket. no one can access it and can only be unlocked with the Presigned Url when a user buys it. \n\nSo yeah these were the 2 challenges I face During the hackathon.",

The Base blockchain provides a secure, scalable, and developer-friendly environment, and I want to contribute by building tools that help grow its ecosystem. This project aims to reduce onboarding friction for new users and developers by ensuring they can easily access tokens to pay for gas fees.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in any blockchain community is ensuring that new users and developers have access to the network and can interact with decentralized applications without friction. Many users don\u2019t have the necessary tokens to pay for gas fees, which can discourage them from exploring the blockchain further. This lack of accessibility is a barrier for both newcomers and developers testing new dApps.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThe Base Faucet project provides a decentralized solution for distributing small amounts of Base tokens to users. This helps them pay for gas fees and encourages exploration of the Base ecosystem. Users can request a limited number of tokens every 24 hours, and developers can use the faucet to easily onboard users for testing dApps. By making it easier for users to participate in the Base blockchain, this project supports the growth and adoption of decentralized applications.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSome of the challenges included:\n\nToken Distribution Mechanism: It was important to create a fair system that prevents abuse (e.g., users spamming requests). I overcame this by implementing a cooldown period of 24 hours between token requests.\nGas Management: Ensuring the smart contract has enough balance to distribute tokens was another concern. I added functionality that allows the faucet owner to easily refill the contract with tokens.\nFrontend Integration: Connecting the faucet smart contract to a simple frontend that allows users to interact using MetaMask required overcoming some Web3.js configuration issues, but I was able to resolve them with documentation."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are participating in Based India because we are already leveraging asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) to solve key financial challenges in India's underserved sectors, particularly in agriculture and small businesses on polygon network. \nWith over $700 million in tokenized assets and partnerships in place with major institutions like the World Bank, Union Bank of India, Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, MSC Bank, TVS Credit, DBS, and Mastercard, we I have already demonstrated our ability to drive impact through asset tokenization and amalgamation of TradFi with DeFi. We have secured $150 million in credit lines, onboarded over 1,500 asset custodians, and provided services to more than 25,000 satisfied customers. We are now expanding beyond India and have already established presence in South East Asia, USA, Central Asia and Africa. \nThese achievements motivate me to scale these efforts even further in partnership with Based India, the largest L2 network of the globe. We seek to partner with base to bring value to Indian unbanked and underbanked communities leveraging the innovative technologies such as Coinbase Smart Wallet, Paymaster etc.  Our project is already live on Base network. \nThe opportunity to leverage blockchain technology to bring financial inclusion to millions of underserved individuals and communities is what drives us at Br\u00fa and partnership with Base will help us achieve these goals at a global level.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe key challenge we are addressing is the $8 trillion credit gap in emerging markets, that disproportionately affects the agriculture sector, small businesses, and rural communities. These sectors are often overlooked by traditional financial institutions, forcing them to rely on informal credit sources with high interest rates. This lack of access to affordable and formal financial services hinders their growth, stifles innovation, and keeps them in cycles of debt.\nIn addition to the credit gap, fragmented markets and low price realization for small farmers further compound the issue. Farmers often face significant hurdles in accessing fair markets for their produce, leading to poor returns and financial instability. These challenges create a systemic problem that limits economic progress and financial inclusion for millions in emerging markets.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission, Br\u00fa Finance, addresses the challenge of financial exclusion by leveraging TradFi and DeFi using asset tokenization to provide affordable credit and financial services to underserved communities, particularly small businesses, farmers, and rural sectors. \n\nUsing Br\u00fa Finance\u2019s innovative approach of tokenizing real-world assets like agricultural commodities, the project enables farmers to use their stored crops as collateral to access loans through a decentralized commodities-backed bonds platform. This allows them to avoid high-interest informal lenders and bypass the barriers of traditional banks.\n\nBy connecting these communities to global liquidity providers, the project ensures they receive loans at lower interest rates while maintaining transparency and efficiency. The platform also facilitates the trade of tokenized assets, enabling farmers and small businesses to sell their products at optimal prices in global markets, improving their overall profitability.\nThe impact of this project is evident in the numbers achieved so far. Br\u00fa Finance has empowered over 25,000 farmers and small businesses by providing access to critical financial resources and has created a robust network of over 1,500 asset custodians. \n\nBy partnering with major institutions like the World Bank, DBS, Union Bank of India, BOB & others, the platform has improved financial inclusion, particularly for small businesses and farmers, by enabling access to affordable credit and reducing reliance on high-interest informal loans. The success of these initiatives demonstrates how Br\u00fa Finance is already transforming underserved markets and addressing long-standing financial gaps.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile working on this project, I encountered both technical and non-technical hurdles that required creative problem-solving.\nBlockchain Integration: One of the biggest challenges was integrating tokenized crop-backed bonds into the blockchain in 2019-20 when we started building. Many of the libraries and standards did not exist back then and hence building proper smart contract functionality to handle asset tokenization, collateralization, and bond issuance required a lot of engineering innovation.\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Navigating the uncertain regulatory environment around DeFi and tokenized assets posed a challenge. \n\nHow We Overcame Them:\nTechnical Solutions: Continuous iteration and testing of smart contracts helped us build a robust blockchain system. We also employed in-house solutions to build asset tokenization platform, oracles and adopted cross-chain solutions to ensure data accuracy and seamless integration.\nStakeholder Engagement: Building trust through education, transparency, and collaboration with local stakeholders such as banks, government and regulators helped in getting the community onboard. Demonstrating clear financial benefits to both farmers and liquidity providers was key to increasing adoption.\nLegal and Regulatory Adjustments: Close collaboration with legal advisors helped us navigate the regulatory landscape, ensuring that our platform remains compliant while protecting stakeholders.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nOur project had a strong foundation before the Buildathon, but we introduced several new features that enhanced both functionality and user engagement and made it more compatible with Base ecosystem: \nCoinbase Smart Wallet:\nWe integrated the Coinbase Smart Wallet into our dApp providing users with a secure, custodian wallet that eliminates the need to worry about private keys. Users can log in through their email, making their wallets easily accessible. Additionally, for enhanced security during transactions, users must authorize each transaction using a passkey stored securely on their device. This setup ensures a user-friendly experience while maintaining a high level of security for farmers and small business owners managing their digital assets.\nCoinbase Paymaster:\nThe integration of Coinbase Paymaster allows for seamless, efficient gas payment processing on Br\u00fa dApp. By simplifying transaction flows and reducing friction, users can easily manage payments and transaction fees, ensuring a smoother process when issuing or redeeming crop-backed bonds. This feature helps make the platform more accessible to both farmers and liquidity providers.\n\nImproved User Interface and Experience:\nThe user interface (UI) was revamped for simplicity and ease of use, especially for non-tech-savvy users like farmers and rural business owners. \n\nThese new features have made our platform more comprehensive, scalable, and accessible, enabling us to better serve farmers, small businesses, and liquidity providers across emerging markets.",

The potential impact is significant, as it can lead to greater independence and innovation for creators in my community and beyond\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1)Technical Challenges: Metadata Storage\nOne major hurdle was deciding where to store the metadata. Initially, we debated between centralized and decentralized options. After revisiting the architecture, we chose to store all metadata in IPFS and host the links as NFTs. This ensured both security and decentralization for the creators' content.\n\n2)Onboarding Creators to Web3\nA non-technical challenge was that many creators are hesitant to dive into Web3, mainly due to the complexity of setting up wallets. To overcome this, we allowed creators to log in with their existing email IDs and abstracted the Web3 components on the backend, making the onboarding process seamless.\n\n3)Data Security\nWe ensured all creator data is stored securely in IPFS, maintaining the decentralized ethos while providing robust content ownership.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe initially aimed to ship the Farcaster Frames feature but ran out of time. However, it will be supported in our next release.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nOur goal in participating in the Based India hackathon is to leverage the power of decentralized technology to address real-world issues such as transparency and trust in voting systems. India is a vibrant democracy with a growing digital landscape, but election integrity remains a significant challenge. By introducing a blockchain-based solution, we hope to provide a transparent and tamper-proof voting platform that can ensure fair elections for all. As someone passionate about both blockchain technology and social impact, this is a great opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the region.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges in our community is the lack of trust in voting systems. Concerns about election fraud, manipulation, and transparency have become common in many democracies, including India. The challenge is to create a solution that ensures the integrity of voting processes and fosters trust among the public. We aim to address these challenges by providing a decentralized system that can\u2019t be tampered with and offers full transparency.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur project tackles this challenge by using blockchain to build a decentralized voting system where every vote is securely recorded and cannot be altered. The blockchain\u2019s immutable nature ensures that every vote is transparent, and the use of smart contracts eliminates the risk of manipulation or double voting. This system can significantly improve election transparency, enabling people to have trust in the voting process and ensuring their voice is fairly represented.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne technical hurdle was integrating MetaMask to allow users to interact with the voting contract directly from their browsers. Initially, I had issues with wallet connection and contract deployment on test networks. Another challenge was ensuring that the smart contract could prevent users from voting more than once while maintaining user anonymity. Through detailed testing and iteration, I managed to resolve these issues and ensure the system operates securely.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe project was built from scratch during the Buildathon, but I added additional features like a front-end interface for easy interaction with the smart contract, ensuring that even users with minimal blockchain knowledge can participate in the voting process."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**The Problem: Urban Mapping Isn\u2019t Keeping Up**\n\nCities are growing fast, but the tools we use to navigate them are stuck in the past. Most current mapping systems rely on static, outdated, or incomplete data\u2014leading to:\n\n- Inaccurate directions and poor route planning\n- Delayed awareness of road hazards or traffic changes\n- Limited insights into what\u2019s really happening on the ground\n- No way to predict issues before they happen\n\nIn short, the maps we use don\u2019t reflect the real-time rhythm of the cities we live in.\n\n**Our Solution: PathPulse.ai \u2013 Smarter Mapping from the Ground Up**\n\nPathPulse.ai is building the next generation of urban mobility technology. By transforming raw video and metadata from everyday vehicle dashcams into live, intelligent, and decentralized maps, we\u2019re creating a system that reflects the actual state of the city\u2014right now.\n\n**What Makes Us Different**\n\n1. *Crowdsourced AI Mapping*: Every driver becomes a data contributor. As vehicles move, real-time video and metadata are used to update maps far more frequently and accurately than traditional systems.\n2. *Predictive AI with PulseNet*: Our platform doesn\u2019t just report what\u2019s already happened\u2014it predicts what\u2019s about to. Using advanced pattern recognition, we can foresee traffic jams, accidents, and road issues before they even occur.\n3. *Millimaps (A New Layer of Digital Maps)*: We\u2019re not just making maps more accurate\u2014we\u2019re rethinking what maps are. Our \u201cMillimaps\u201d are living, digital twins of cities that reflect not just geography, but also real-time social, environmental, and economic activity.\n4. *Community-Powered with $PULS Rewards*: Users who contribute valuable data earn $PULS tokens. This incentive structure builds a vibrant, self-sustaining community of drivers and data providers who keep the system active and reliable.\n5. *End-to-End Hardware + Software*: We design both the hardware and the software, ensuring high-quality, AI-optimized data across different regions and driving conditions.\n6. *Open to All*: With the Pulse Scout app and our easy-to-use devices, anyone\u2014from taxi drivers to delivery fleets\u2014can participate and benefit from the system.\n\n**How It Works**\n\n- We combine real-time analytics, predictive AI, and big data\n- Our system processes micro-level driving data to reveal patterns most systems miss\n- Navigation maps update in real time as new data flows in\n- City planners, businesses, and drivers get insights based on real-world conditions, not assumptions\n\n**Where It\u2019s Used**\n\n- Detecting road hazards and incidents as they happen\n- Optimizing delivery and transit routes in real time\n- Helping cities plan and maintain infrastructure proactively\n- Monitoring traffic and environmental patterns\n- Rewarding users who contribute data through a token-based system\n\n**The Bigger Impact**\n\n*PathPulse.ai is more than a mapping tool\u2014it\u2019s a real-time intelligence layer for cities. By blending predictive AI, community-powered data, and cutting-edge hardware, we\u2019re enabling smarter, safer, and more sustainable mobility systems. This is the future of how cities move\u2014and how we move through them.*\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Problem 1: Multi-Device Camera Integration**\n\n***Challenge:***\nIntegrating dash cams from multiple car manufacturers proved difficult due to variations in camera hardware specifications, data transmission protocols, and lack of standardized interfacing methods.\n***Solution:***\nWe addressed this issue using *SPTP (Simple Picture Transfer Protocol) sniffing*. By establishing a local server, we redirected the camera data streams to a centralized host through protocol sniffing and custom-built handlers. This abstraction allowed our application to interface seamlessly with a wide variety of dash cams, ensuring stable and consistent data ingestion across multiple devices.\n\n\n**Problem 2: Lack of Training Data for Model Development**\n\n***Challenge:***\nThere was a scarcity of relevant real-time annotated data required to train the AI models, particularly for identifying road features such as accident-prone zones, street lighting conditions, and object classification in diverse conditions.\n***Solution:***\nTo overcome this, we launched a *data collection campaign*, recruiting a team of volunteers to gather real-world footage. Volunteers were instructed to capture specific image data and metadata such as GPS coordinates and timestamps. These curated datasets allowed us to develop a robust training pipeline for our AI model, incorporating edge-case scenarios and enhancing detection accuracy across diverse urban and rural landscapes.\n\n\n**Problem 3: Integration Limitations of YOLO with Telematics Hardware**\n\n***Challenge:***\nThe YOLO object detection model, while accurate, was computationally intensive and incompatible with the limited processing capacity of our in-vehicle telematics hardware.\n***Solution:***\nWe developed a proprietary lightweight object detection model named PulseNet. PulseNet was engineered specifically for edge deployment\u2014it is faster, consumes fewer resources, and delivers accurate and precise results under real-time constraints. This enabled seamless AI inference directly on the telematic device without compromising speed or accuracy.\n\n\n**Problem 4: Inability to Determine Contextual Object Positioning**\n\n***Challenge:***\nAlthough PulseNet was effective in detecting objects, it lacked the ability to provide contextual spatial information, such as whether the object appeared on the left, right, or center of the road\u2014critical for navigation and road behavior analysis.\n***Solution:***\nTo resolve this, we introduced an extension module called PulseGen, designed to compute contextual positioning metadata. PulseGen works alongside PulseNet to analyze object placement relative to road geometry, thus enabling the system to identify lane-specific object locations. This improvement allowed for the generation of highly accurate and geo-contextualized mapping data.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nOur team has been exploring blockchain technology recently, and we see Based India as the perfect opportunity to showcase what we've learned. We're excited to immerse ourselves in a fast-paced development environment, connect with amazing creators in the Indian blockchain community, and see some incredible projects firsthand. Participating will allow us to challenge ourselves, build something impactful, and contribute to the growing blockchain ecosystem in India.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on two significant challenges in the blockchain ecosystem. First, there is a prevalent lack of understanding and familiarity with blockchain technology among everyday users. Many individuals perceive terms like \"blockchain\" and \"on-chain apps\" as intimidating or complex, creating a barrier that prevents them from exploring the Web3 space. This confusion often leads to missed opportunities for engagement and innovation in this transformative technology.\n\nSecond, even those who are interested in blockchain face a practical hurdle: acquiring tokens needed to interact with decentralized applications (dApps). For many newcomers, the process of purchasing or obtaining tokens can be convoluted and financially daunting. This often discourages potential users from diving deeper into the blockchain ecosystem and limits the overall growth of the community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nTo tackle these challenges, we are developing a social media dApp that retains the familiar social aspects of traditional platforms while incorporating unique features of decentralized applications. Our aim is to create an intuitive user experience that allows individuals to engage with blockchain technology without needing to navigate complex technicalities.\n\nA crucial element of our solution is the integration of Base, which provides user-friendly wallet functionality and facilitates a smooth onboarding experience. This allows users to create and manage their wallets effortlessly, reducing the intimidation factor often associated with blockchain technology.\n\nAdditionally, one of the standout features of our submission is the Base Sepolia faucet, which offers free access to tokens. This is a game-changer for newcomers who want to experiment with dApps but may be hesitant due to the inability to acquire tokens. By allowing users to receive tokens for free, we remove a significant barrier to entry and provide them with the opportunity to explore the capabilities of blockchain technology firsthand.\n\nThrough our social media dApp, users will not only experience the basic functions of social interaction but also gain insights into the decentralized world. We aim to create an engaging environment where users can post, share, and connect, all while subtly introducing them to the principles and advantages of Web3. By lowering the entry barriers and simplifying the onboarding process, we hope to foster a more inclusive blockchain community that empowers everyone to participate.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding this blockchain application presented several challenges. Initially, implementing CRUD operations with hooks, especially for blockchain integration, was a steep learning curve. I relied heavily on documentation and community resources to grasp these concepts, as it was my first experience with blockchain development.\n\nAnother significant hurdle was testing the application. Accessing Sepolia ETH for testing purposes proved difficult due to limitations on available tokens. To overcome this, I had to ask friends to set up MetaMask wallets and send Sepolia test ETH through faucets. This process was time-consuming and highlighted the importance of sufficient testing resources from the outset.\n\nFurthermore, the project faced ongoing updates and changes in blockchain technology. Each update required adjustments to ensure compatibility and functionality, adding complexity to development and testing phases.\n\nDespite these challenges, navigating through them has been a valuable learning experience, refining my skills in blockchain development and project management. Each obstacle has contributed to strengthening the robustness and resilience of the application as it progresses towards completion.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nAlthough our project was initiated before the Buildathon, we utilized this opportunity to significantly enhance its functionality and user experience. During the Buildathon, we integrated the Base Sepolia faucet, allowing users to access tokens for free, which has streamlined the onboarding process for newcomers to the blockchain space. Additionally, we focused on refining our interactive user interface to improve engagement, incorporating features like post editing, likes, and comments to create a more dynamic social media experience. These enhancements not only make the platform more user-friendly but also promote active participation within the community, encouraging users to explore the potential of decentralized applications.",

Our mission is to empower creators to foster creativity and community engagement through gamified experiences, ultimately driving the growth of digital content creation.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building the MemeCoin Battle web app, several challenges emerged across technical, blockchain, and user experience domains. Implementing real-time game mechanics where users vote in 1-minute rounds required precise state synchronization, minimal latency, and scalable vote tallying, which was particularly challenging with concurrent participants. Launching the winning meme as an onchain token on the Base chain introduced further complexity ensuring secure, seamless deployment, unique tickers, and integrated tokenomics without disrupting the user experience. The credit-based voting system added another layer of difficulty, as it had to prevent spam and manipulation while allowing flexible participation and post-launch chat rooms demanded consistent identity handling and smooth data sync across decentralized systems. On the blockchain side, managing liquidity for newly launched tokens and fairly distributing presale allocations to creators and players required well-designed, trustless mechanisms. Preventing pump-and-dump behavior was also critical, necessitating tokenomics that incentivized long-term holding and community engagement through daily tasks and active participation in post-launch chat rooms.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nRENTIFY - Revolutionizing Digital Rentals\nHey there! Welcome to the Rentify project - a game-changer in how we access premium digital tools. We built this specially to solve a real problem we all face.\n\nThe Big Idea\nLook, we've all been there. You need Adobe Photoshop for just one project. Or maybe you want to try that expensive AI tool everyone's talking about. But dropping hundreds of dollars for something you'll use occasionally? That hurts.\n\nThat's where Rentify comes in. We're not your typical rental platform - we're smarter. Rentify connects people who aren't currently using their software accounts with people who need temporary access at rock-bottom prices.\n\nThink about it - how many subscription accounts sit idle for weeks or months? With Rentify, account owners can list their unused time and make back some cash, while others get premium tools at a fraction of the regular cost. It's a win-win!\n\nHow It Works\nRentify's pretty straightforward:\n\nFor account owners: Not using your premium software for a while? List your account's available time on Rentify and set your price\nFor users: Browse available accounts by category - Creative Software, AI Tools, Digital Assets, Gaming and more\nChoose what you need - Access premium accounts for days or weeks at incredibly low prices\nInstant access - After payment, you'll get immediate access to the account credentials\nUse & create - That's it! Return the account when you're done\nOur platform ensures smooth handoffs and clear usage terms, with automatic notifications when the rental period is ending. The streaming-style interface makes discovering available accounts as easy as finding your next binge-worthy show.\n\nSecurity That Actually Works\nSecurity isn't just a feature for us - it's our foundation. Here's how we keep everything locked down:\n\nEnd-to-end encryption for all transactions and personal data\nSecure credential management with automatic password resets after rentals\nMulti-factor authentication to protect all accounts\nTokenized payment processing that never stores your full card details\nRegular security audits by independent cybersecurity firms\nWe've built everything using modern web security practices with robust server-side validation and protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF attacks.\n\nFighting Digital Piracy\nLet's talk straight - software piracy hurts everyone. It hurts developers who pour their hearts into creating amazing tools. It hurts legitimate users who end up paying more. And honestly, it hurts pirates too - with malware risks, no support, and the constant worry about legal issues.\n\nRentify offers a better way. We've created an affordable, legitimate alternative that:\n\nMakes use of accounts that would otherwise sit idle\nProvides users with safe, fully-functional software at prices anyone can afford\nIncludes proper support and community help\nEliminates legal and security risks of pirated software\nBy making premium tools accessible at fair prices, we're addressing the root cause of piracy - not just treating the symptoms.\n\nReady to transform how you access digital tools? Join us at Rentify and discover a smarter way to create.\n\nGet Started\nClone the repo\nOpen index.html in your browser\nExplore the future of digital rentals\nBuilt with passion by the Rentify team for Base Batch hackathon\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udd10 1. Security & Credential Management\nChallenge: Securely sharing login credentials without exposing sensitive info.\n\nSolution: You tackled this with end-to-end encryption, automatic password resets, and multi-factor authentication.\n\nOngoing Risk: Preventing misuse or multiple concurrent logins during rentals.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f 2. Legal & Licensing Concerns\nChallenge: Many software licenses explicitly forbid account sharing or subleasing.\n\nSolution: Framing Rentify as a \"time-share\" style access model that doesn\u2019t alter or resell software, just connects idle time.\n\nOngoing Risk: Ensuring compliance with software terms of service to avoid platform takedown or lawsuits.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 3. Trust & Platform Integrity\nChallenge: Making users trust that rented accounts are legit, not banned, or compromised.\n\nSolution: Reputation systems, verified listings, secure transitions, and password resets after each rental.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 4. Technical Implementation\nChallenge: Managing rental time windows, scheduling, auto-notifications, and credential delivery in real time.\n\nSolution: Likely required a custom backend with timers, notifications, and credential obfuscation or vault-like storage.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 5. UX for a New Concept\nChallenge: Designing a UI that explains a new rental concept clearly and feels as seamless as Netflix or Spotify.\n\nSolution: \u201cStreaming-style\u201d account browsing with easy access flows and categorization.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 6. Payment & Refund Systems\nChallenge: Handling small-time, peer-to-peer rentals securely without storing sensitive financial info.\n\nSolution: Tokenized payments with zero card data storage, probably using third-party processors like Stripe or Razorpay.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 7. Preventing Abuse or Exploits\nChallenge: Renters misusing accounts, changing passwords, using after expiration, or violating ToS.\n\nSolution: Smart monitoring, automated resets, clear usage policies, and maybe limited permissions.",

Traditional estate planning often overlooks digital holdings, leaving heirs unable to access or claim them due to lost keys or unclear instructions. Legacy-Onchain empowers users to create a digital virasat by storing funds, NFTs, or videos in a blockchain-based vault, designating heirs, and crafting genie-inspired NFTs that unlock only upon the owner\u2019s verified passing. This ensures privacy, security, and a magical, user-friendly experience, bridging the gap between digital wealth and posthumous legacy\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAs Legacy-Onchain is under development, several challenges have emerged:\n\n\nDeath Verification: Reliably verifying a user\u2019s passing without compromising privacy is complex. We\u2019re exploring decentralized oracles and trusted third-party APIs to securely confirm death certificates or legal documents on-chain, ensuring NFTs unlock only when conditions are met.\n\n\n\nSmart Contract Security: Ensuring the immutability and safety of smart contracts for asset storage and NFT unlocking is critical. We\u2019re conducting rigorous audits and using frameworks like Hardhat to test for vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nUser Experience: Balancing a mystical, genie-themed UI with intuitive functionality for non-technical users is tricky. We\u2019re iterating on designs to make asset uploads, heir designation, and NFT customization enchanting yet simple.\n\n\n\nScalability: Handling large volumes of assets (e.g., high-resolution videos) on IPFS and Ethereum-compatible blockchains can be costly. We\u2019re optimizing storage with compression and exploring layer-2 solutions like Polygon for cost-efficiency.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Compliance: Navigating global laws on digital inheritance and cryptocurrency transfers is challenging. We\u2019re consulting legal experts to ensure compliance with data protection and estate laws.\n\nThese challenges are being tackled through iterative development, community feedback, and partnerships with blockchain and legal experts to make Legacy-Onchain a robust, magical platform.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nAs an emerging blockchain developer with a strong passion for decentralized technologies, participating in Base India provides an incredible opportunity to contribute to India's growing Web3 ecosystem. India has become a hub of innovation in the blockchain space, and I want to be a part of this transformation. The region\u2019s rapid adoption of cutting-edge tech, along with its thriving developer community, motivates me to showcase my skills and build impactful solutions.\n\nBeing connected to India through my education and background, I see immense potential in applying blockchain solutions to real-world problems, especially in finance, governance, and e-commerce. Base India gives me a platform to collaborate, learn, and contribute to this dynamic landscape while pushing the boundaries of decentralized technology.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThrough Base, I'm addressing key challenges in trust, security, and transparency within financial transactions in my community. Traditional escrow systems in industries like freelancing, e-commerce, and real estate often involve high fees, delays, and reliance on intermediaries, which can lead to trust issues.\n\nBy building decentralized solutions like the AI-powered escrow system, I aim to:\n\nEliminate intermediaries: Provide a trustless platform that reduces costs and increases efficiency.\nEnhance transparency: Ensure that transactions are secure and transparent through smart contracts on the blockchain.\nStreamline dispute resolution: Leverage AI to assist in fair and unbiased dispute resolution, especially in communities where legal frameworks are slower or inaccessible.\nWith the help of Base, I'm creating tools that empower individuals and businesses to engage in secure, cost-effective transactions, fostering greater trust and adoption of decentralized technologies.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy submission, the AI-Powered Decentralized Escrow System, directly tackles the challenges of trust, transparency, and efficiency in financial transactions. By utilizing the Polygon blockchain, the system allows two parties (Payer and Payee) to engage in secure, trustless transactions where funds are held in a smart contract escrow until all conditions are met.\n\nKey impacts include:\n\nTrustless Environment: The decentralized nature of the system eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and preventing potential fraud.\nTransparent Transactions: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability, making it easy for users to track and verify the flow of funds.\nEfficient Dispute Resolution: In case of disputes, the AI-powered Arbiter provides fair and impartial suggestions for resolution, helping to solve conflicts faster and more efficiently.\nGlobal Reach: By building on Polygon, the system offers low-cost, fast transactions that can be accessed by users globally, particularly benefiting communities where access to reliable legal and financial systems is limited.\nThis project not only addresses the technical challenges of secure payments but also has the potential to increase financial inclusion and security for individuals and businesses.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the major technical hurdles was integrating the AI-powered dispute resolution with the blockchain-based escrow smart contract. It was crucial to ensure that the interaction between on-chain data and the off-chain AI model was seamless and secure. To overcome this, we built a secure API to allow the smart contract to query the AI model hosted on a Flask server, without compromising the decentralized nature of the project.\n\nAnother challenge was optimizing gas fees on Polygon. Handling disputes and escrow transactions involves multiple contract interactions, so we worked on optimizing the smart contract code to reduce gas costs. Through rigorous testing using Foundry and constant optimizations, we were able to lower transaction costs while maintaining functionality.\n\nWe also faced a learning curve when working with advanced blockchain tools like Wagmi and Viem for frontend smart contract interaction. With practice, thorough research, and community support, we were able to successfully integrate these tools, making the front-end user experience smooth and reliable.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nIt was fully built during buildathon",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nInferno enables DeFi developers and API creators to confidently launch payment-gated services on Base by stress-testing x402 micropayment infrastructure before production. Developers can simulate realistic payment volume by spawning thousands of concurrent agents making authentic x402 requests, identify bottlenecks early by discovering performance degradation and transaction failures, test on Base testnet risk-free by executing full payment flows without production risk, measure actual gas economics to understand transaction costs at scale and optimize pricing, and reduce go-to-market friction by deploying with confidence knowing payment infrastructure is battle-tested. Instead of manually testing with a handful of users or hoping payment systems work at scale, developers get production-ready validation through automated, comprehensive stress testing tailored to x402 micropayment flows on Base.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe primary challenge was understanding the x402 payment flow specification and translating it into a robust simulation engine that accurately reproduces real-world micropayment scenarios on Base. The x402 protocol involves multiple steps\u2014initial API requests, 402 responses, transaction construction, signing, and authenticated retries\u2014and getting the transaction signing and gas estimation correct for Base's EVM environment required deep familiarity with ethers.js and Base's RPC interactions.\nAnother hurdle was managing concurrent agent execution at scale without overwhelming the RPC endpoint or creating bottlenecks. Implementing proper rate limiting, wallet rotation, and error handling for failed transactions took careful consideration.\nWe overcame these by studying the x402 specification thoroughly, testing the engine locally against a mock x402 server to validate payment flows, and implementing incremental improvements to concurrency management. Moving forward, we're focused on building the CLI and dashboard components to make the engine accessible to developers, which will require translating engine metrics into meaningful performance insights and creating an intuitive configuration interface.",

No more fake resumes-your skills are verified, portable, and yours forever. It's built for 5M+ engineering students to prove skills globally.\n\nAce DSA solves these big problems in tech learning and hiring:\n\n1) Learning Progress Can Be Manipulated or Lost\nCentralized platforms control leaderboards and progress data. For example, CodeChef once reset user ratings, making hard-earned progress vanish overnight.\n\n2) Users Don\u2019t Truly Own Their Achievements\nPlatforms like LeetCode and CodeChef lock your streaks, badges, and rankings within their apps. You can\u2019t carry or prove your progress outside their ecosystem.\n\n3) Generic Leaderboards Ignore Personal Learning Needs\nOne-size-fits-all rankings push users to chase easy wins instead of improving weak areas, leading to unbalanced skill development.\n\n4) Grinding Is Rewarded More Than Real Learning\nDaily streaks and badges often reward repetition, not actual understanding\u2014causing burnout and shallow practice.\n\n5) Hard to Stay Consistent Without the Right Support\nMany learners struggle with regular DSA practice because most platforms don\u2019t motivate or adapt to individual learning journeys.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was integrating onchain actions with real-time user activity. We needed the AI agent to not only personalize daily DSA challenges but also reliably trigger the minting of NFT badges when users completed them. Ensuring this process was seamless, secure, and gas-efficient took a lot of iteration.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n\ud83c\udf00 Fragmented Bill Splitting Experience\nMost existing bill-splitting tools (like Splitwise) are centralized, disconnected from payment platforms, and require manual tracking. There\u2019s no seamless way to track, pay, or verify payments \u2014 users still need to pay via separate apps like Paytm, Venmo, or UPI.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f Lack of Onchain Transparency\nCurrent apps don\u2019t offer onchain tracking. There's no transparent, immutable ledger showing who paid what, when, or how. This creates trust issues and confusion within friend groups.\n\n\u23f3 Pay Later but Trust Issues\n\"Pay Later\" agreements often rely on personal trust, with no real system to ensure someone will pay. Friends become uncomfortable asking for repayments.\n\n\ud83e\uddfe No Escrow or IOU Security\nExisting platforms lack secure, automated escrow mechanisms. There\u2019s no way to lock funds in a smart contract and enforce repayment obligations onchain.\n\n\ud83d\udcac No Social Accountability\nSocial pressure and gamification can motivate people to pay promptly \u2014 but current platforms do nothing to encourage good behavior. There's no way to make repayments visible or \u201ccool\u201d in a social setting.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Integrating WalletConnect with Frames/MiniKit\nOne of the biggest technical challenges was integrating WalletConnect functionality smoothly within a Farcaster Frame and MiniKit context. Managing session persistence and ensuring secure connections across different environments (web, mobile) was non-trivial.\n\n\ud83d\udcdc Smart Contract Design for IOUs & Escrow\nDesigning smart contracts that fairly represent IOUs and allow \u201cPay Later\u201d logic required thoughtful architecture. Ensuring they were gas-efficient, secure, and allowed both parties to settle or dispute required iteration and testing.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 UX for Onchain Interactions\nTranslating complex blockchain actions like signing, escrowing, and splitting into a user-friendly UI inside Frames was tricky. Many users are new to web3, so creating a seamless flow without confusing the user was a key challenge.\n\n\ud83e\uddea Farcaster Frame Constraints\nFarcaster Frames have limited interactivity compared to full dApps. Balancing what could be done inside a Frame vs. redirecting to a full page for payment flow required trade-offs and creative decisions.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Stablecoin Payment Flow\nImplementing Base USDC payments with proper fallback handling (e.g., insufficient balance, gas estimation) required real-time feedback to users and solid wallet integration logic.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security Considerations\nHandling user funds \u2014 even in escrow \u2014 demanded careful contract auditing, replay protection, and making sure users couldn\u2019t spoof payment status or skip repayments.\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Time Management & Coordination\nManaging smart contract deployment, UI/UX design, wallet integrations, and social logic within a short timeframe (hackathon or sprint) meant rapid prototyping and prioritizing core features.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nMillions of Indians hold crypto assets, but using them for everyday transactions remains painfully difficult. Existing solutions require multiple steps\u2014off-ramping to INR, waiting for bank settlements, and manually paying via UPI. This process can take hours or even days, is error-prone, and often comes with high fees or compliance risks.\n\nValut solves this by letting users pay with stablecoins (like USDC) directly at any UPI-enabled merchant. With one simple flow\u2014Scan, Select, Pay\u2014users scan a merchant\u2019s existing UPI QR code, select a stablecoin, and the merchant receives INR instantly via UPI. Merchants don\u2019t need to know or interact with crypto at all.\n\nUnlike competitors who require merchants to adopt new systems or apps, Valut is plug-and-play for end users, instantly compatible with 200M+ existing UPI endpoints in India. This improves usability, shortens transaction time to seconds, and brings real-world utility to crypto in India for the first time.\n\nHow it works:\n- The user scans any UPI QR code using the Valut app or browser extension.\n- Valut decodes the UPI payment info and generates an INR quote in USDC or other supported stablecoins.\n- The user confirms the transaction and pays via their crypto wallet.\n- Valut's backend swaps the stablecoin into INR through a compliant partner, then instantly pushes the INR to the merchant via UPI.\n- The merchant sees a standard UPI payment\u2014no additional steps or crypto knowledge needed.\n\nValut makes crypto spending as seamless as using a bank card, while maintaining compliance and real-time settlement.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was gaining access to PSP (Payment Service Provider) APIs for programmatic INR payouts. Most Indian PSPs don\u2019t allow crypto-related platforms to use their payout APIs, which blocked us from automating UPI transfers initially.\n\nTo work around this, we manually initiated UPI payouts for a small set of users through internal tools to validate the flow and gather early feedback.\n\nWhile building toward automation, we also had to design a transaction tracking system. we architected a hybrid solution using Etherscan APIs and The Graph to monitor wallet activity and token transfers. This helped us accurately track pending, successful, and failed transactions across both on-chain and fiat layers, ensuring transparency and reliability in the settlement process.",

This environment instilled in me a builder's mindset from an early age.\nAs I grew older, I came to fully appreciate the scale of India's 1.4 billion population. This vast number represents not just challenges, but incredible opportunities. To truly become a global powerhouse, India needs solutions that address the needs of people from all regions and walks of life.\nThe success  UPI , Aadhar and ONDC demonstrates India's readiness to adopt transformative technologies at a national scale. These are great examples of how we can build systems that work for our entire population.\nI firmly believe that our 1.4 billion citizens are our greatest strength. By focusing on solving their problems, promoting financial inclusion, and enhancing social security, we can drive remarkable change. Building Rozi for Based India is my way of contributing to this vision and helping to unlock our country's full potential.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe gig economy in India represents a transformative shift in employment, blending traditional informal work with digital platform-based opportunities. This emerging sector, encompassing both platform and non-platform gig work, intersects with India's vast unorganized sector, creating a complex landscape that impacts millions of workers. As it grows, the gig economy presents both opportunities and concerns regarding worker protections and economic stability. Projections indicate significant growth, with the gig workforce expected to reach 23.5 million by 2028. \n\nBased on in-depth conversations with 8 gig workers employed by platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto, I've compiled this list of challenges. These insights reflect the real-world experiences and concerns shared by those at the forefront of India's gig economy:\n\n### \ud83d\udea7 Challenges Faced by Gig Workers in India\n1. \ud83d\udd04 Job Insecurity: Lack of permanent status leads to **financial instability**.\n2. \ud83d\udcb8 Income Instability: **Irregular earnings** make financial planning difficult.\n3. \u2696\ufe0f Lack of Legal Protection: **Limited coverage under labor laws** leaves workers __vulnerable__.\n4. \ud83c\udfe5 Absence of Social Security Benefits: **No health insurance, retirement benefits, or paid leave**.\n5. \ud83e\udd1d Unequal Bargaining Power: __Difficulty negotiating fair compensation__ and conditions.\n6. \ud83d\udcb3 Payment Issues: **Delayed or non-payment** of wages is common.\n7. \ud83d\udcda Lack of Training and Career Development: Limited opportunities for **upskilling and advancement**.\n8. \ud83d\udcc4 Lack of Formalization: Informal sector operation __restricts access to resources__.\n9. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Inadequate Government Recognition: **Minimal recognition** contributes to lack of support.\n10. \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f Exploitation Through Legal Loopholes: Absence of specific laws enables **potential exploitation**.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nTo address the challenges faced by gig workers, I am building **Rozi** - a revolutionary platform for gig worker welfare. Leveraging the **Base blockchain** for speed and scalability, Rozi aims to create a more secure, transparent, and empowering ecosystem for gig workers across India.\n\nKey Features of Rozi:\n1. \ud83d\udcca **Data Integration**: Import work history from platforms like Swiggy, Uber, and Urban Company using zk proofs via Reclaim protocol.\n2. \ud83d\udd10 **On-chain Trust Score**: Create a decentralized, verifiable identity and trust score that evolves with each gig and payment.\n3. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Tiered Benefits**: Unlock various levels of insurance, loans, and subsidies based on trust score improvements.\n4. \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f **$ROZI Token**: Governance token enabling workers to participate in on-chain unions and decision-making.\n5. \ud83d\udcb0 **P2P Lending**: Access loans based on trust score, with incentives for lenders.\n6. \ud83d\udd0d **Direct Gig Marketplace**: Connect workers directly with users, eliminating middlemen.\n7. \u26a1 **Instant Payments**: On-chain transactions for immediate compensation.\n8. \ud83d\udcc8 **Performance Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of activities, performance, and cashflow.\n9. \ud83d\udd17 **Open Protocol**: Develop vertical-specific apps (e.g., for cooks, maids, electricians) on the Rozi framework.\n10. \ud83e\udd1d **Platform Integration**: Allow existing platforms to utilize Rozi's on-chain trust score system.\n11. \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **Multi-lingual Support**: Native support for all Indian languages, ensuring accessibility for workers across the country.\n#### \ud83d\ude80 What's Next for Rozi?\n\nMy step is to develop open SDKs and APIs, making it effortless for developers to integrate with the Rozi protocol. This will foster the creation of truly open experiences for gig workers, enhancing their lives while passing benefits to end-users. By enforcing trust and security, we're building a future where middlemen are obsolete, and the gig economy thrives on direct, secure, and beneficial relationships between workers and clients.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Challenges in Building Rozi\n1. **\ud83d\udcf1 User Experience (UX) Paramount**\n   - Designing for **uneducated workers** required extreme simplification\n   - Traditional Web3 concepts like \"connect wallet\" were unsuitable\n   - __Multiple UI iterations__ based on user feedback were necessary\n2. **\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Language Barrier**\n   - English-only interface was insufficient\n   - **Implemented support for all Indian vernacular languages**\n3. **\ud83d\udd11 Simplifying Access**\n   - Integrated **social login** for familiar authentication\n   - Implemented **account abstraction** to hide complex blockchain interactions\n4. **\ud83e\udde9 Feature Integration**\n   - Combining multiple features into a single app was overwhelming\n   - Required careful planning and modular development\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Vision for the Future\nI am excited to evolve Rozi into the **\"UPI for workers\"** in India. My goal is to create the first population-scale system powered by Web3 infrastructure, making decentralized technology accessible and beneficial for millions of gig workers across the country.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# The Problem Vega Protocol Solves\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Overview\n\nVega Protocol eliminates the complexity of building, deploying, and monetizing multi-agent AI systems by providing a unified platform with built-in orchestration, payment rails, and agent discovery.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc94 The Problems\n\n### **1. Agent Orchestration is Complex & Time-Consuming**\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n- Manually chaining API calls between multiple AI agents\n- Writing hundreds of lines of orchestration code\n- Handling dependencies, retries, and error states\n- Building execution engines from scratch\n- Managing parallel vs sequential execution logic\n\n**Real Cost:** 2-3 weeks of development time per workflow\n\n---\n\n### **2. No Standardized Agent Marketplace**\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n- Developers rebuild similar agents repeatedly\n- No central registry to discover existing agents\n- Difficult to share and reuse agent implementations\n- No way to monetize specialized agent work\n- Finding the right agent for a task requires manual research\n\n**Real Cost:** Wasted development resources, duplicated effort\n\n---\n\n### **3. Payment Integration is a Nightmare**\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n- Integrating Stripe/PayPal takes weeks\n- Building escrow and refund logic manually\n- Handling payment failures and edge cases\n- No automatic per-agent billing\n- Centralized payment processors take 3-5% fees\n\n**Real Cost:** 3-4 weeks of development + ongoing 3-5% platform fees\n\n---\n\n### **4. Frontend Development Requires Backend Expertise**\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n- Frontend developers must understand workflow engines\n- Need to build APIs for agent management\n- Complex state management for execution monitoring\n- No type-safe abstractions\n- Mixing business logic with infrastructure code\n\n**Real Cost:** Slower development, more bugs, higher maintenance\n\n---\n\n### **5. No Trust or Quality Guarantees**\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n- Can't verify agent identity or capabilities\n- No reputation system to assess quality\n- Risk of malicious or unreliable agents\n- No feedback mechanism for users\n- Difficult to choose between competing agents\n\n**Real Cost:** Security risks, poor user experiences\n\n---\n\n## \u2728 How Vega Protocol Solves These Problems\n\n### **1. Declarative Workflow Orchestration**\n\n**Instead of writing this (500+ lines):**\n```typescript\n// Custom orchestration engine\nclass WorkflowOrchestrator {\n  async executeWorkflow(steps: Step[]) {\n    // Handle dependencies\n    // Manage state\n    // Implement retries\n    // Track progress\n    // Handle errors\n    // Process payments\n    // ... 500+ more lines\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Write this (20 lines):**\n```yaml\nname: executive-discussion\nnodes:\n  - id: ceo\n    ref: agent-ceo\n    inputs: { productIdea: \"{{inputs.productIdea}}\" }\n  - id: cmo\n    ref: agent-cmo\n    depends: [ceo]\n  - id: cto\n    ref: agent-cto\n    depends: [ceo]\nedges:\n  - from: ceo\n    to: [cmo, cto]\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- \u2705 95% less code\n- \u2705 Automatic dependency resolution\n- \u2705 Built-in retry logic\n- \u2705 Parallel execution optimization\n- \u2705 Validation before execution\n\n---\n\n### **2. Centralized Agent Registry**\n\n**Discover & Use Agents Like NPM Packages:**\n\n```typescript\n// Search for agents\nconst agents = await client.agents.search({\n  category: 'text-processing',\n  chain: 'base',\n  maxPrice: 0.50\n});\n\n// Get agent details\nconst transformer = await client.agents.getById('text-transformer');\n\n// Use in workflow immediately\nnodes:\n  - id: transform\n    ref: text-transformer  # From registry!\n    inputs: { text: \"hello\", operation: \"uppercase\" }\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- \u2705 Browse 100+ pre-built agents\n- \u2705 Filter by category, chain, price\n- \u2705 View agent capabilities and pricing\n- \u2705 One-click integration into workflows\n- \u2705 Publish your own agents for others to use\n\n**Real Example:**\nInstead of spending 2 days building a text summarizer, find one in 30 seconds:\n```bash\nagentic-cli agents search --category=\"text-processing\" --keyword=\"summarize\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Built-In Payment Rails (x402 Protocol)**\n\n**No Custom Payment Integration Required:**\n\n```typescript\n// That's it! Payments handled automatically\nconst result = await client.workflows.execute({\n  yaml: workflowYaml,\n  userId: 'user123',\n  userWallet: '0xYourWallet'\n  // Payment automatically:\n  // 1. Budget reserved\n  // 2. Agents paid on success\n  // 3. Unused funds refunded\n  // 4. Settled on-chain (USDC on Base)\n});\n```\n\n**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**\n1. **Pre-Execution:** Budget reserved from user wallet\n2. **During Execution:** Each agent paid on completion\n3. **Post-Execution:** Unused budget automatically refunded\n4. **Settlement:** On-chain USDC transfers (transparent & verifiable)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- \u2705 Zero payment integration code\n- \u2705 Automatic escrow and refunds\n- \u2705 Pay-per-use model (only pay for completed work)\n- \u2705 On-chain settlements (no platform lock-in)\n- \u2705 Multi-chain support (Base, Base Sepolia, more coming)\n- \u2705 No 3-5% platform fees\n\n**Cost Comparison:**\n\n| Approach | Development Time | Platform Fees | Total Cost (Year 1)\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n8 Major Technical Challenges:\nA2A SDK Integration (404 Error) - JSON-RPC endpoint confusion and how I fixed it\nCircular Dependency Detection - Graph algorithm implementation for workflow validation\nTemplate Variable Resolution - Nested object access with safe error handling\nPayment Integration - Optimistic verification without expensive blockchain nodes\nTypeScript Package Exports - Dual CJS/ESM build configuration\nAgent Registry Performance - Indexing optimization (10x-100x faster)\nCLI User Experience - Making the CLI beautiful and delightful\nMonorepo Management - Workspace configuration and build orchestration\nFor Each Challenge:\n\u2705 The Problem - What went wrong and why it was confusing\n\u2705 The Solution - Detailed code examples showing the fix\n\u2705 Key Learnings - Takeaways from solving it\n\u2705 Impact - Measurable improvements (performance, UX, etc.)",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe believe that the present and future crypto adoption begins on the Base ecosystem. \nSo there is no better place to start building for the blockchain community. \n\nBase has the most open, accessible and fast feedback community, and that makes it the best place to test new ideas and improve.\n\nWe have been part of FBI (Farcaster Builders India) and Levitate efforts to build on base. And we want to extend their vision to bring base closer to the new devs and users joining base. \nOur team lives in India - Bangalore and Hyderabad.\n\nIndia is a growing economy and the devs here are solving for the world. We are bullish on India and committed to bring India onchain.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIt is very hard to keep up with the base ecosystem, there is just so much happening.\n\nSometimes, it becomes overwhelming. Especially if you are new to the base ecosystem.\n\nAnd reading through docs, blogs, casts or tweets is liking being in a maze to find the correct way.\n\nWhen creating DApps, it is hard for Devs to navigate the base docs, or get help while writing smart contracts.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nSo we trained an AI model for base. (Yes, it is not a ChatGPT wrapper)\n\nThis AI model acts as a base assistant for the community.\n\nUsing Base Intelligence, you can write or audit smart contracts, talk with base docs and even convert rust program to solidity.\n\nYou want to know more about base - just ask.\nYou want to talk with base docs - just ask.\nYou are building Dapp and have tech queries - just ask.\nYou want help writing code - just ask.\nYou want to convert rust program to solidity code - just ask. \nYou want to audit your smart contract - just ask\n\nBase Intelligence will do it for you.\n(And you know what, it calls you by your basename.)\n\nSo head over to it, signup with your wallet and get started on base.\nOnce you signup, you will see an NFT dropped to your wallet. (It marks your first step into the LVModel's ecosystem)\n\nIn future, \nYou will be able to check your onchain balance, swap, stake, follow whales, or mint NFTs, compare yields, ape memecoins right from base intelligence.\n(We are building the foundation model for Blockchain, the journey starts here.)\n\nP.S. \nAs a Dev, your next Dapp will be much easier to build. \nAs a Based person, your next interaction with base will be much easier with base intelligence.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSetting up an extremely fast retrieval RAG pipeline for all of the base documents was quite challenging due to the vast amount of information. However, we overcame this by creating a semantic database using scrapers and synthetic data formatting with our LLM. From there, we built the RAG pipeline from scratch.\n\nThat made the responses fast and eventually better user experience.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n1. Product in One Sentence\n\nBase Cartel is an onchain, social-strategy game on Base where users earn, steal, and redistribute value through provable onchain actions like raids, referrals, and alliances, turning attention and activity into a competitive economic game.\n\n\n\n2. What\u2019s the Problem Statement\n\nMost onchain applications today struggle with sustained user engagement. Incentives are often passive (airdrops, yield farming) or purely financial, which leads to short-term participation and rapid drop-off once rewards dry up. Social layers exist, but they are usually offchain, opaque, and disconnected from actual value flow.\n\nAt the same time, new primitives like x402 enable programmable, HTTP-native payments, but they are mostly used in isolated, utilitarian contexts. There is very little exploration of how payments, incentives, and social behavior can combine into a persistent, competitive system that rewards real activity rather than speculation.\n\nUsers lack:\n\nMeaningful reasons to stay active daily\nTransparent, onchain reward distribution\nSocial competition that actually affects outcomes\nSystems where reputation, behavior, and economic impact are directly linked\n\n\n\n3. How is this solved today?\n\nToday, most projects solve engagement through:\n\nPoints systems that are offchain and easily exploitable\nCentralized leaderboards with no economic consequence\nOne-time incentives like NFTs or tokens\nSocial tasks that can be farmed without verification\n\nGames that do exist often rely on closed logic, custodial assets, or complex tokenomics that are hard to reason about and difficult to extend.\n\nThere is no standard way to build a trust-minimized, event-driven social economy where actions between users directly move value onchain.\n\n\n\n4. How does Base Cartel improve this flow?\n\nBase Cartel introduces a fully onchain, event-driven social economy where every meaningful action has economic consequences.\n\nKey improvements:\n\nOnchain-first logic: Raids, referrals, rewards, and penalties are enforced by smart contracts, not assumptions.\nConflict-based incentives: Value flows based on interaction (raiding, defending, betraying), not passive holding.\nTransparent revenue flow: Fees generated by activity are visible, measurable, and claimable.\nReputation with purpose: REP is earned through verifiable actions and used to unlock gameplay advantages.\nComposable with x402: Payments, agents, and automation can interact with the system using standard HTTP-native payment flows.\n\nInstead of farming points, users are competing in a live, onchain power structure.\n\n\n\n5. How does the final product flow work?\n\na. User joins the Cartel\nA user connects their wallet and joins the game, receiving initial shares that represent their stake.\n\nb. Activity generates value\nUsers perform actions like raids or high-stakes raids. These actions:\n\nTransfer or burn shares\nGenerate protocol revenue\nEmit onchain events\n\nc. Revenue is distributed transparently\nFees collected from activity flow into a shared pot. Distribution logic determines how much each user can claim based on their shares and participation.\n\nd. Social dynamics emerge\n\nReferrals bring new users and rewards\nAggressive players rise on the \"Most Wanted\u201d list\nClans coordinate actions\nBetrayal and defense change outcomes\n\ne. Automation & agents\nUsing x402, agents can:\n\nPay to fetch intelligence\nTrigger actions\nAutomate strategies\n  All without custodial trust or centralized control.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nBase Cartel turns onchain activity into a living social economy\u2014where behavior, conflict, and coordination directly shape who earns, who loses, and who controls value. It\u2019s not just a game or a payment system, but a framework for experimenting with incentive-driven social coordination onchain.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nI come from a non-technical background and I\u2019m not a coder by training, so the biggest challenge was simply understanding how things actually work under the hood. In Web3, a lot of concepts sound simple on the surface, but once you start building, you realize how many moving parts there really are \u2014 smart contracts, indexers, APIs, frontend state, and how all of them interact.\n\nTo build this, I relied heavily on LLMs and AI agents as my primary way of learning and implementing features. That helped me move much faster, but it also introduced a different kind of challenge:\nmost of the time, the agent would try to solve problems based on assumptions instead of deeply understanding the existing codebase. This led to situations where things \u201cworked\u201d temporarily, broke something else, or had to be rewritten entirely.\n\nBecause of that, a lot of the development process became iterative and experimental \u2014 designing systems, testing them, breaking them, auditing them, and rebuilding them properly once the flaws were clear. Many core systems (joins, revenue, quests, reputation) went through multiple versions before they were stable.\n\nThe hardest part wasn\u2019t writing code \u2014 it was learning how to think like a system designer without a traditional technical foundation, and validating every assumption manually. I got through it by slowing down, doing read-only audits first, breaking big problems into smaller ones, and being willing to throw away work when the architecture wasn\u2019t right.\n\nIt was challenging, sometimes frustrating, but also the most valuable learning experience of the project.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# X4PN VPN: The Problem & Solution\n\n---\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nX4PN VPN addresses a fundamental flaw in the **$481B VPN market**: users are currently forced to rent privacy through wasteful monthly subscriptions, while decentralized alternatives fail because they rely on volatile tokens that break the network when prices crash.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Subscription Waste & \"Lock-in\"\n*   **The Struggle:** Most users only need a VPN for specific moments (traveling, accessing geo-blocked content, public Wi-Fi), yet they must pay **$13/month** regardless of whether they use it for 1 minute or 100 hours.\n*   **The X4PN Solution:** A true **Pay-Per-Minute** model. You deposit USDC once and are charged only for the exact time you are connected (e.g., $0.10). If you don't use it, your balance remains yours.\n\n### 2. Fixing the \"Liquidity Trap\" of Decentralized Networks\n*   **The Struggle:** Competitors like Mysterium failed because they forced users to pay in a custom token (MYST). When that token's trading volume dried up, users couldn't buy it, and the network became unusable.\n*   **The X4PN Solution:** A **Two-Token System** powered by x402. Payments settle in **USDC** (always liquid, always $1.00), ensuring the VPN works perfectly even if the reward token (X4PN) price fluctuates.\n\n### 3. Turning Privacy into an Asset (Use-to-Earn)\n*   **The Struggle:** Traditional VPNs are a \"sunk cost\"\u2014money leaves your wallet and never comes back.\n*   **The X4PN Solution:** Every minute you use the VPN, you earn **X4PN tokens** as a reward. Active users and light node verifiers can essentially offset their privacy costs or even profit, turning a monthly expense into a potential income stream.\n\n---\n\n## What People Can Use It For\n\n### \ud83c\udf0d For The Global Traveler (Digital Nomads)\n*   **Use Case:** You are at an airport for 30 minutes and need secure Wi-Fi.\n*   **Old Way:** Sign up for a 1-month VPN plan or risk hacking.\n*   **X4PN Way:** Connect for 30 minutes, pay exactly **$0.30**, and disconnect. No cancellation fees, no recurring billing.\n\n### \ud83d\udd10 For Web3 Natives & Crypto Users\n*   **Use Case:** Accessing dApps or exchanges geo-blocked in your region.\n*   **Old Way:** Trusting a centralized VPN provider with your IP and data logs.\n*   **X4PN Way:** Use a decentralized node that cannot log your data because it's encrypted via WireGuard and payments are pseudonymous on-chain.\n\n### \ud83d\udcbb For Bandwidth Providers (Passive Income)\n*   **Use Case:** You have gigabit fiber internet at home that sits idle while you're at work.\n*   **Old Way:** Let the bandwidth go to waste.\n*   **X4PN Way:** Run a node agent on your computer. Earn **USDC** in real-time from users routing traffic through your connection, plus **X4PN** governance rewards.\n\n### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f For Privacy-Conscious Developers\n*   **Use Case:** Testing applications from different global IP addresses.\n*   **Old Way:** Manually configuring proxies or buying expensive enterprise VPN tiers.\n*   **X4PN Way:** Switch between decentralized residential IPs instantly, paying only pennies for the few minutes needed to test.\n\n---\n\n## How It Makes Tasks Easier & Safer\n\n| Feature | How It Makes Life Better |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **x402 Auto-Settlement** | **Easier:** No manual credit card entry or monthly invoices. You connect, and the protocol handles the micro-payments in the background every 60 seconds. |\n| **Stablecoin Payments** | **Safer:** You pay in USDC. You don't have to gamble on holding a volatile crypto token just to use a utility service. |\n| **Decentralized Architecture** | **Safer:** There is no single central server to hack or subpoena. Your traffic is routed through a distributed network of encrypted nodes. |\n| **Light Node Verification** | **Easier:** You don't need to trust if a node is honest. The network automatically verifies service quality and slashes nodes that underperform. |\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n# Challenges I Ran Into\n\nBuilding a decentralized VPN that settles payments every 60 seconds on-chain presented several unique engineering challenges. Here are the major hurdles we faced and how we solved them.\n\n### 1. The \"Zombie Session\" Problem with WireGuard\n**The Hurdle:** WireGuard is a connectionless protocol, meaning it doesn't natively track \"sessions\" like TCP. We encountered a bug where users would close their laptop (disconnecting abruptly), but the Node Agent would think the session was still active. This caused the x402 protocol to keep charging the user's balance for ghost minutes.\n\n**The Solution:** We implemented a \"Heartbeat + Handshake\" monitor in the Node Agent.\n*   Instead of relying on a simple \"connected\" status, the agent now checks the **latest handshake timestamp** from the WireGuard interface every 30 seconds.\n*   If no handshake is received for >120 seconds, the agent automatically triggers the `endSession()` function on the smart contract.\n*   This ensures users are never charged for time they aren't actually sending data, protecting their USDC balance.\n\n### 2. Synchronizing Off-Chain Speed with On-Chain Settlement\n**The Hurdle:** Our goal was a seamless \"pay-per-minute\" experience, but blockchain transactions (even on Polygon) are not instant. Initially, we tried to force a transaction *exactly* at the 60-second mark. If the network was congested, the transaction would hang, and the next minute's settlement would fail because the previous nonce was still pending.\n\n**The Solution:** We decoupled the **accounting** from the **settlement**.\n*   **Accounting (Off-chain):** The x402 facilitator tracks usage in real-time (e.g., \"User owes $0.30\").\n*   **Settlement (On-chain):** We implemented a \"Optimistic Batching\" strategy. If the user's balance is sufficient, the node allows the session to continue and batches the settlement transaction every 5-10 minutes (or upon disconnect) to save gas.\n*   **Security:** To prevent loss, the user must lock a small \"security deposit\" (e.g., $2 USDC) at the start. If the batched settlement fails, the deposit covers the node's risk.\n\n### 3. The \"Double-Spend\" of Bandwidth\n**The Hurdle:** In our early tests, a malicious user could potentially share their private key with five friends, allowing all of them to connect to the VPN simultaneously while only paying for one session. Since WireGuard keys are static, the node couldn't easily distinguish them.\n\n**The Solution:** We built a dynamic **Session-Key Generation** flow.\n*   When a user clicks \"Connect,\" the Node Agent generates a *temporary, ephemeral* WireGuard private key pair specifically for that session ID.\n*   This key is sent to the user and whitelisted on the server.\n*   As soon as the session ends (or payment stops), the key is immediately revoked and deleted from the server configuration. This makes key-sharing impossible.\n\n### 4. Handling Stablecoin Approvals UX\n**The Hurdle:** New Web3 users found the \"Approve USDC\" -> \"Deposit USDC\" flow confusing. They would approve the token but forget to sign the second transaction to actually deposit, leading to \"Insufficient Funds\" errors when they tried to connect.\n\n**The Solution:** We utilized **EIP-2612 (Permit)** for gasless approvals where possible, but primarily improved the UX by bundling the flow.\n*   We redesigned the Extension UI to check the allowance first.\n*   If allowance is 0, we present a single \"Unlock & Deposit\" flow that guides them through both signatures sequentially without closing the modal.\n*   We also added clear, non-technical tooltips explaining *why* two signatures are needed (\"First allow the secure vault to read your balance, then move the funds\").",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nOnce a majority of Indians are Onchain, a lot of use cases like Government schemes, voting, lending and finance will be unlocked with the ability to use globally built crypto primitives as building blocks. With a large community of local Base builders, we should be able to get there soon!\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe challenge was to build something that can help bring more people on chain using the convenience of Base ecosystem. From supporting a small creator to an IPL team, the goal was to provide incentives for both these entities and their fans to join Base and the overall web3 community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\n2base is a platform where users can create ERC20 tokens linked to accounts on platforms such as X/Twitter, GitHub and YouTube. Tokens are minted and burned using a bonding curve. Each mint and burn accrues a fee which is reserved for the web2 account linked to the token. The web2 account can claim ownership of a token by submitting a zkTLS proof of account ownership using Reclaim Protocol. Once completed, the web2 account owner can claim fees accrued. This is frictionless due to the gasless transactions on Base.\nUsing 2base, users can create launch profiles linked tokens of their favourite web2 creators. This can range from supporting the owner of a GitHub repo to a sports team on X/Twitter. Since the tokens are fair launched and fees are reserved for actual subjects linked to the tokens, this helps bring a sense inclusivity and part ownership of the entity linked to the profile. Also, this helps bring more followers of the entity on chain to own tokens and be a part the onchain community linked to their favourites.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n* Integrating Reclaim protocol Solidity verification due to latest SDK not being published and Solidity version mismatch issues. Additionally, some of the methods were buggy and needed correction. We implemented some of the methods in Reclaim.sol in our contracts and imported some of the files from the SDK in our project. Additionally, some of the React integration document was outdated and methods needed replacement. Generating proofs on Android was slightly difficult to figure out.\n* Testing the full flow on hardhat was a bit difficult as verification could only happen on Sepolia.\n* Gas issues with ERC20 token factory instance deployment. Had to move some functions from token to factory to manage gas.\n* Integrating wallet connection using OnchainKit lead issues rendering the Name and Avatar component when disconnected.\n* Integrating Transactions using OnchainKit instead of wagmi hooks was a learning curve but the end experience was a lot smoother.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nKlyro is a builder discovery and scoring platform designed to help hackathon organizers, Web3 communities, and airdrop teams find real builders with verifiable proof of work\u2014all in one place.\n\nWe started with a simple idea: there\u2019s no easy way to discover actual contributors in Web3. GitHub alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, and wallet activity without context is just noise. So we built Klyro to bridge that gap.\n\nWith Klyro, **organizers can spin up customizable registration forms**\u2014just like Google Forms\u2014but instead of collecting just names and emails, they ask for a GitHub handle and wallet address. Once a participant submits, Klyro automatically **analyzes their full builder footprint**.\n\nWe go beyond surface-level tracking. Klyro pulls together data from multiple sources and deeply analyzes:\n\n- Open source Web3 contributions  \n- Active smart contracts they\u2019ve deployed  \n- TVL in those contracts  \n- Number of unique users interacting with their work  \n- GitHub code activity and engagement  \n- Code quality and Lines of code written\n- Hackathons they\u2019ve participated in or won  \n- Overall project ecosystem contributions  \n\nAll this happens across multiple chains, which organizers can filter too!!!\n\nFrom all of this, we generate a comprehensive builder score and a shareable on-chain resume that showcases the builder\u2019s real skills and achievements\u2014backed by verifiable, public data.\n\nThis score isn\u2019t inflated or gamified. **We\u2019ve intentionally designed the scoring to be rigorous, rewarding impact over vanity**. Builders who ship real code, deploy live contracts, and solve meaningful problems get recognized.\n\nOn the organizer\u2019s side, Klyro makes it incredibly simple to:\n\n- View rich, ranked profiles of all applicants  \n- Filter and shortlist based on real data  \n- Send automated acceptance or rejection emails  \n- Export data or plug into your workflows  \n\nNo more spending hours manually vetting GitHub profiles or checking if wallets are real. Klyro does it all\u2014instantly.\n\nWe launched just yesterday and have already onboarded 100+ builders in less than 24 hours, all organic.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\n**We\u2019re expanding Klyro beyond just developers**. Next up: scoring systems for Web3 marketers and creators\u2014people who grow communities, create content, drive adoption, and contribute in non-technical but equally vital ways.\n\nOur vision is to become the talent layer for Web3\u2014a unified, verifiable, and trusted platform where anyone can showcase their work, and any community or project can discover the right contributors with proof, not promises.\n\n**With Klyro, communities can grow smarter, airdrops can be fairer, and builders finally get the recognition they deserve**.\n\nWe also have a Farcaster mini app https://miniapp.klyro.dev/\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Challenges I Ran Into:\n\n- Data Normalization: Aggregating and standardizing diverse data from GitHub, various chains, and protocols was complex due to inconsistent formats.\n\n- On-chain Attribution: Linking contracts to specific builders reliably, especially when deployments weren\u2019t tied directly to ENS or known wallets.\n\n- Scoring Logic: Designing a fair, transparent scoring system that balances quality and quantity across GitHub and on-chain contributions.\n\n- Spam Prevention: Ensuring the form system isn't abused with fake or low-quality submissions without manual review.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nOur voice-activated AI agent simplifies the decentralized finance (DeFi) experience by addressing common challenges such as complex interfaces, security concerns, and accessibility issues.\n\nKey Features:\n\t\u2022\tEasy Trade Execution: Users can perform trades seamlessly using simple voice commands, eliminating the need for navigating complex interfaces. (Have to yet Trained much)\n\t\u2022\tTeam Coin Creation: The AI agent allows users to create team coins in an interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing format, making the process more accessible for both beginners and experienced users.\n\t\u2022\tMarket Insights & Alerts: The agent provides real-time market insights, price alerts, and risk assessments, helping users stay informed and make smarter trading decisions.\n\t\u2022\tAutomated Strategies: Based on AI-driven market analysis, users can execute automated trading strategies for better portfolio management and optimized returns.\n\t\u2022\tSeamless Integration: The AI is compatible with popular wallets and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring a smooth and secure transaction experience. (This has to be done further)\n\nThis approach not only enhances accessibility but also promotes broader adoption of DeFi services, making it easier, safer, and more efficient for individuals to engage in decentralized finance.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building our voice-activated DeFi AI agent, we faced a significant hurdle with speech recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments and with users who had diverse accents. This issue is quite common in voice-activated applications, where misinterpretation of commands can occur due to background noise or the varied speech patterns of users.\n\nTo overcome this, we implemented the following solutions:\n\t\u2022\tAdvanced Natural Language Processing (NLP): We trained our AI models on a diverse dataset that included various accents, dialects, and speech patterns. This allowed the system to better understand and process a wide range of voice inputs, ensuring accurate command interpretation from all users.\n\t\u2022\tNoise-Cancellation Algorithms: To minimize the effect of background noise, we integrated noise-cancellation technology into the AI agent. This step helped improve the accuracy of speech recognition, even in environments with a lot of ambient sound.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, we improved the reliability and usability of our DeFi AI agent, making it accessible and efficient for users in various environments.",

For the buildathon, we have built Baseedge Trading Simulator that helps users do a comparative analysis of their trades would have performed with automatic stop loss and laddered sells in place. \n\nThis emerged from conversations we had with the top traders on Base Ecosystem. The single biggest problem traders face today is timing a trade. During trending metas, traders struggle to manage risk and lock in profits due to high volatility and fast price movements.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nTalking to top Base traders\n- Given the fact that crypto traders are significant targets of scammers and drainers, talking to our core TG - Traders of Base was challenging - People refused to come on calls or Google Meet.\n- We tried doing paid conversations with users using paid messages on Debank - still, 50% of users did not reply\n- Most conversations took place in farcaster or Twitter DMs. The whole process Async and slow\n\nReliably getting swap Txn data for wallets.\n- It was quite a task to get accurate data for the wallet txn history reliably.\n- First challenge was to segregate swaps from other txns, cycled through 2 API providers, and finally ended up using a combination of Coingecko onchain data + Zerion wallet API\u2019s\n\nSimulating a strategy for a token in under 1s\n- To do a comparison between traders' natural behaviour vs comparing performance to a trading strategy requires around 100 trade simulations.\n- Doing all these simulations in under 20 seconds and returning a PNL comparison required building a distributed data ingestion and processing capabilities.\n    - Get User wallet history and filter out trades(swaps)\n    - Fetch Token OHLC for traded tokens\n    - For each timestamp in the user\u2019s wallet history, use the same quantity to simulate the trading strategy.\n    - Get data from simulations to do PNL analysis.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nIndia's vibrant digital community inspires us. We recently hosted an event in Delhi specifically for this hackathon, bringing together 87 passionate builders to co-create on Base. This experience reinforced our belief in India's collaborative spirit and readiness for blockchain innovation.\n\nWe're here because:\n\n1. We believe in empowering India's 750 million internet users to be true stakeholders in their digital experiences.\n\n2. Our platform naturally aligns with India's community-driven culture, enabling users to have a real stake in the online spaces they value.\n\n3. By building on Base, we aim to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for everyday Indian users.\n\nOur goal is to challenge the status quo of corporate networks with their high take rates and limited user ownership. We envision a digital economy where Indian users aren't just content creators, but true owners of their online communities. By leveraging blockchain technology, we're creating a system where engagement directly translates into ownership and value, free from the extractive models of traditional platforms.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n## 1. Centralized Control and Manipulation\n\n- Platforms can arbitrarily manipulate content visibility and community access\n  - Example: Reddit temporarily shut down r/WallStreetBets during the GameStop stock surge\n  - This action favored large hedge funds over individual investors\n  - Demonstrated how centralized platforms can interfere with community-driven movements\n- Social networks can change algorithms or ban/shadow ban accounts at will\n  - Directly impacts creator earnings and community reach\n  - Users have no recourse against sudden changes or arbitrary decisions\n\n## 2. Unfair Value Distribution and Monetization\n\n- Most social networks (e.g., Facebook, Reddit) have a take rate of over 95%\n  - Platforms capture and keep almost all the network value for themselves\n  - Creators receive only a tiny fraction of the value they generate\n- Creators struggle to monetize their content effectively\n  - Forced to rely on inconsistent ad revenue or sponsorships\n  - Platform algorithms can significantly impact earning potential\n  - No direct correlation between community value and creator earnings\n\n## 3. Lack of True Ownership and Trust\n\n- Users have no ownership of their accounts, content, or digital identities\n  - Example: When Twitter became X, it took the @x handle from a user who had been using it for 12 years\n  - Platforms can unilaterally change usernames, remove content, or terminate accounts\n- No guarantee of long-term access to one's digital presence\n  - Years of content creation and community building can be lost instantly\n  - Users' digital legacies are at the mercy of corporate decisions\n- Lack of transparency in content moderation and account management\n  - Unclear policies and inconsistent enforcement erode user trust\n  - No true appeals process for most platform decisions\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\n## 1. Decentralized Control and Community Empowerment\n\nDapps leverages Base's blockchain infrastructure to create a fully decentralized platform:\n\n- **No Arbitrary Shutdowns**: Communities on Dapps cannot be unilaterally shut down or censored.\n  - Example: A situation like the r/WallStreetBets shutdown would be impossible on Dapps.\n- **Transparent Governance**: All platform decisions are made through smart contracts and community consensus.\n- **Algorithm Transparency**: Changes to content distribution algorithms are implemented through open-source smart contracts.\n\n**Potential Impact**: Dapps could foster truly free and open online communities, immune to corporate or external pressures.\n\n## 2. Fair Value Distribution and Creator Empowerment\n\nDapps introduces a revolutionary model for value distribution:\n\n- **Minimal Platform Fees**: Dapps takes only a fraction of a percent in fees, compared to 95%+ on traditional platforms.\n- **Community Shares**: Users can buy shares in communities they value, directly supporting creators.\n- **Creator Earnings**: Creators earn 5% of the value each time a share in their community is traded.\n\n**Potential Impact**: This model could transform the creator economy, providing sustainable income streams that grow with community engagement.\n\n## 3. True Digital Ownership and Trust\n\nDapps ensures users have full ownership and control over their digital assets:\n\n- **Immutable Ownership**: Usernames, content, and community shares are owned via smart contracts on Base.\n  - Example: A situation like losing the @x handle would be impossible on Dapps.\n- **Portable Digital Identity**: Users can carry their reputation and content across different Dapps communities.\n- **Transparent Moderation**: Content moderation is governed by community-set rules enforced through smart contracts.\n\n**Potential Impact**: Dapps could set a new standard for digital rights and ownership in the social media space.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## 1. User Onboarding Complexity\n\n**Challenge:** Introducing Web3 concepts like wallets and gas fees to new users initially proved overwhelming.\n\n**Solution:** \n- Developed a streamlined onboarding process featuring:\n  - Embedded wallets\n  - Gasless transactions\n- Created interactive tutorials to guide users through their first community share purchase\n\n**Outcome:** \n- Significantly reduced the learning curve\n- Made the platform more accessible to crypto novices\n\n## 2. User Experience vs. Decentralization\n\n**Challenge:** Balancing a seamless user experience with true decentralization principles presented a significant challenge.\n\n**Solution:** Adopted a progressive decentralization approach:\n- Implemented core functions like share issuance and trading fully on-chain\n- Maintained some off-chain components to ensure a smooth user experience\n- Established a clear roadmap to gradually increase decentralization over time\n\n**Outcome:** \n- Allows effective onboarding of users\n- Maintains alignment with Web3 principles\n- Provides a path for increasing decentralization as the platform mature\n\n## Additional Features\n\nDuring the Buildathon, we introduced two significant features to enhance the Dapps ecosystem:\n\n## 1. ActivityPub Integration\n\n- Implemented ActivityPub support, making Dapps communities interoperable with the fediverse\n- Allows users to interact seamlessly with platforms like Mastodon\n- Community posts can now reach a wider audience across the decentralized social web\n- Maintains the unique tokenized structure of Dapps communities\n\n**Impact:**\n- Bridges the gap between traditional social networks and our Web3 platform\n- Significantly expands our potential user base\n\n## 2. Community-Specific Games\n\nDeveloped a framework for creating and deploying community-specific games within Dapps:\n\n- Games are designed to increase engagement and provide additional value to community shares\n- Example: Prediction market game\n  - Community members can use their shares to bet on future events related to the community's focus\n  - Game outcomes can influence share values\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Gamifies the community experience\n- Encourages more active involvement\n- Potentially attracts game enthusiasts to join various communities\n\n**Impact:**\n- Adds an exciting dynamic to community participation and investment\n- Enhances the overall value proposition of Dapps communities\n- We now have over 75,000+ users on the waitlist",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nThe Base network is growing rapidly and a lot is happening in the ecosystem. A lot of new users are getting onboarded to actual on-chain web3 through Coinbase and Base. We want our app to be available to all the new users on Base and hence are trying to make parts of the LensView experience available for Base users directly.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nPeople browse the internet alone and without a \"compass\". LensView provides a sense of direction and awareness about every webpage on the web for safer navigation. Interact with peers as you navigate the internet. Make informed online decisions and stay away from fraud and scams. \n\nWe also provide incentives to creators who help others navigate the web safely by enabling p2p tipping functionality among users.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nLensView aims to be the hub for reviews and discussions on the web by allowing users to share their thoughts and views about any webpage on the internet with everyone else in the world. By being the \u201comni-present comment section\u201d of the internet, LensView seeks to start a new paradigm of online discourse which has never been seen before. \n\n- Fact-check news articles on the internet or inform others about misinformation in them.\n- Get feedback and reviews about products (by on-chain verified accounts) before purchasing items from any e-commerce website.\n- Report phishing websites and also avoid getting scammed by checking the LensView comments for the website.\n\n\nUnlike other centralized comment sections on e-commerce websites or media outlets, LensView is completely decentralized, permissionless and is cross platform. By verifying the authenticity of comments posted by users through their on-chain activity, LensView seeks to be a source of trusted information about web pages.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe had a hard time trying to figure out how to take advantage of the growing interests in the Base network, in a way that would be meaningful to LensView. We finally came up with the concept of tipping creators in popular meme coins on Base. This would incentivize others to contribute genuine and quality posts to LensView while making a small buck. \n\nWith the help of Base network, Lens Protocol and LensView, we aim to create a community of people who engage in meaningful conversations while browsing the internet and are incentivized to help others by sharing their thoughts and views about various webpages.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWe have built a tipping module for LensView and have integrated Base network to it. This enables people to tip creators in their favourite meme coins on Base. \n\nThis incentivizes people to contribute quality content to LensView and engage in meaningful conversations with others while browsing the internet.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am participating in this hackathon with a focus on India because of the significant growth of the blockchain ecosystem in the region. India has a rapidly growing community of developers and entrepreneurs who are looking for blockchain solutions that are both cost-effective and scalable. By building on Base, I aim to contribute to this community by addressing local challenges like high transaction fees and the need for better blockchain adoption tools, which can empower more users and developers in India to participate in the blockchain revolution.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe main challenge I am focusing on is the fluctuating gas fees that users experience when interacting with the Base blockchain. These fluctuations make it hard for users to predict the cost of their transactions, and in many cases, users overpay due to lack of insight into optimal times for transactions. This challenge is especially relevant in regions like India, where cost-efficiency is critical for encouraging more widespread adoption of blockchain technologies.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThe BaseChain Gas Tracker provides users with real-time gas price data, allowing them to optimize the timing of their transactions and reduce fees. Additionally, users can view historical gas price trends to identify patterns and set notifications for when gas fees drop below a certain threshold. This transparency helps users save on transaction costs, improves the overall user experience on the Base blockchain, and encourages more efficient usage of blockchain resources.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of the BaseChain Gas Tracker, one of the main challenges was fetching real-time gas prices from the Base blockchain in a reliable manner. Initially, some of the RPC calls we used didn't return consistent results. To overcome this, I integrated multiple sources for price data and built a caching mechanism to ensure that the app always had up-to-date gas price information. On the frontend side, integrating Chart.js with real-time data updates was a technical hurdle, but I was able to resolve it by handling asynchronous data loading more effectively."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am participating in Based India to leverage my skills in building innovative and engaging projects that contribute to the crypto community. I aim to connect with like-minded developers, share ideas, and create solutions that enhance user experiences in the blockchain space. This hackathon presents a unique opportunity to learn, collaborate, and push the boundaries of creativity and technology.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI am focusing on the challenges of user engagement and education in the crypto space. Many newcomers find it difficult to understand blockchain concepts and navigate the crypto ecosystem. By developing an interactive game like 'Catch the Base Logo', I aim to provide a fun and engaging way for users to learn about cryptocurrency while developing their skills. This project also addresses the challenge of creating a welcoming community, encouraging collaboration and participation among both new and experienced users\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy project, 'Catch the Base Logo', is an interactive game designed to engage users in the world of cryptocurrency in a fun and educational way. Players click on animated Base logos that appear on the screen, simulating a playful environment that encourages interaction.\n\nThis project addresses the challenge of user engagement by transforming complex crypto concepts into an accessible and enjoyable experience. As players interact with the game, they not only learn about the Base ecosystem but also develop their awareness of cryptocurrency in general.\n\nThe potential impact of this project is significant: by making learning about crypto fun, I hope to inspire more people to explore the technology and consider its applications. Additionally, it fosters a sense of community as players can share their experiences and encourage others to join in, ultimately promoting a more inclusive and informed crypto community.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAnimation Timing: I struggled with timing the animations to ensure that the logos appeared and disappeared in a way that felt engaging. To address this, I adjusted the CSS keyframes and timing functions until I achieved a smooth flow that kept players interested.\n\nResponsive Design: Ensuring that the game functioned well on both desktop and mobile devices was a challenge. I focused on using flexible layouts and media queries to optimize the user experience across various screen sizes.\n\nUser Engagement: Finding the right balance of difficulty and fun was tricky. I gathered feedback from potential users and iterated on the gameplay mechanics to make it both challenging and enjoyable.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nScoring System: Players can now see their score displayed on the screen, which updates in real-time as they catch logos. This motivates users to improve their scores with each session.\n\nCountdown Timer: A countdown timer was added to create a sense of urgency. Players have a limited time to catch as many logos as possible, increasing engagement and challenge.\n\nRandomized Logo Sizes: To add variety and excitement, I randomized the sizes of the Base logos. Some logos are larger, making them easier to catch, while others are smaller, adding a challenge.\n\nGame Over Screen: Upon reaching the end of the countdown, a \"Game Over\" screen appears, displaying the final score and offering the option to restart the game. This gives players a sense of completion.\n\nBackground Music: I included background music that plays while the game is active, enhancing the overall atmosphere and making the experience more enjoyable.\n\nResponsive Design: The game was optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am participating in Based India hackathon to contribute towards building a more efficient and scalable infrastructure on the Base blockchain. My goal is to leverage Base's capabilities to create innovative solutions that address challenges like low engagement and cost-efficient user participation, particularly in form responses and surveys.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are addressing the challenge of increasing user response rates for forms in a cost-effective way by leveraging Base's micro-transaction capabilities. \n\nBy using micro-transactions and features like affiliates, dynamic rewards, and automated workflows, we incentivize users to complete forms without incurring high costs for form creators. This approach helps boost engagement while maintaining affordability.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission tackles the challenge of low form response rates by offering a range of innovative tools through FormPilot that incentivize and reward users for completing forms. We've designed features to increase participation and generate valuable insights for form owners.\n\nBy talking to various founders and community managers, we identified common challenges and developed a suite of tools to address them. Here\u2019s how we help you get more responses and better insights:\n\n\nPlatform Tools:\n\nAffiliates\nEscrows\nReal-time & static rewards\nLLM Validator & Summarizer\nVoting\nAirdrops\nMarketplace\nIntelligent Taps + Embedded Forms\nAutomated workflows\nKey Use Cases:\n\nReward-based Feedback Forms:\n\nStatic rewards: Every user submitting the form receives the same reward.\n\nDynamic rewards: Based on the quality of the response in form the rewards will vary for each submission. \n\nTo check quality - AI LLM  agent will train on the  form questions and  description based on the quality score they given the rewards will vary \n\nNon-reward Feedback Flow:\n\nForm owners manually review responses and approve or disapprove them. Only approved responses are eligible for rewards.\nEscrow-based Giveaways:\n\nLoad tokens or NFTs into escrow pools, allowing users to claim them upon form submission.\n\nLLM Summarizer:\nAutomatically generate a summarized version of all user feedback, helping you understand overall sentiment and insights.\n\nDAO-style Voting:\nAllow users to vote on specific options, gathering their preferences and opinions.\n\nInstant Airdrops:\nConfigure escrow pools to automatically distribute airdrops to users after form submission.\n\nAffiliate Program:\nUsers who submit forms through an affiliate URL earn commissions for the affiliate owner.\n\nMarketplace:\nUsers can browse a variety of reward-based forms (both paid and unpaid) to complete and earn rewards.\n\nThese features create multiple pathways to increase engagement, reward participation, and offer actionable insights for form creators.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the major challenges I faced while running my SaaS platform was the fluctuation in user engagement. To understand the reasons behind this, I sent out survey forms to users, but the response rate was extremely low. This issue persisted even others shared the different surveys in various WhatsApp / Social groups, making it difficult to gather insights. It became clear that finding a cost-effective way to encourage users to provide feedback and complete forms was a significant challenge.\n\nAnother technical challenge we encountered was designing and configuring a real-time, multi-chain escrow pool and reward flow that could handle high traffic and provide dynamic, instant rewards. Ensuring this architecture was both scalable and efficient required considerable effort.\n\nSolutions We Implemented\n\nTo overcome these hurdles, we developed features like dynamic and static real-time rewards, affiliates, and other engagement-boosting tools. These features incentivized users to fill out forms and significantly increased response rates, all while keeping costs low. Additionally, we carefully designed a scalable architecture for the real-time reward flow and escrow pool, which ensured seamless handling of high traffic and user rewards.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nAdded various integrations and features into form builder tool.\n\nIntegrated & Developed  unified escrow pool that supports BASE into the platform",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nBased India is an incredible platform to share my work in front of people who are currently working on Base chain and experimenting to bring new capabilities.\n\nHave been a fan of Jesse (head of Base) and how he has been leading the project. Grateful for this opportunity. I have been interested in crypto and decentralization since 2013. Only in the last few years have I started building services around enabling crypto and Base has created a great ecosystem to help devs achieve their imaginations on chain and not worry about gas.\n\nAs someone who has many ideas and builds many things, getting attention is probably the most difficult thing and Based India has provided a great platform to showcase our builds. Grateful once again.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of my friends, Jon, recently built a game (thisispointless.fun). He was building in public, sharing the game mechanics and level progress.\n\nHe published level 1 of his game on X and received overwhelming response from everyone. Everyone was trying to finish the game. On day 1, I was on leaderboard and then everyone jumped in. Soon it became a headache to deal with if people had hacked the leaderboard or did they genuinely achieve that score. He is also not a dev, he's using gpt to hack together the code.\n\nThe database is running on mongodb on heroku, people were not sure if a player genuinely achieved their highscore or did they hack it.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOne of the ways I felt to address this was to make a service that would save the scores and achievements to the Base chain.\n\nThis brings transparency for players, and the service saves time for Jon and other game devs to bring their games on chain and not worry about auth, security and other issues.\n\nThere is a similar service in android called google play games, it saves a ton of headache to make your leaderboard, save scores, create leaderboard, save achievements. Allows the game devs to focus on their game and not worry about other issues.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1.Setting up the project locally was a bit of an issue, you have to spin your local evm and rpc and consume it on the browser. But it took a few hours. Used the hardhat n/w and was able to solve it.\n\n2.When I ready to deploy on testnet, the first contract was highly unoptimized. The gas fees went to $200 to create a game on chain. Then after optimization (took me hours) went to $20 or so. \n\n3.3rd challenge which is an important challenge which I haven't tackled yet, but I have an idea on how to solve is to prevent players from directly interacting with contract. Have a friend who worked on a similar problem and he recommended using ECDA signature for verification. Right now I don't know how to implement it, but it'll be on the contracts soon.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nI didn't start the project before the Buildathon. Started working on it on Oct 7th or so.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nImagine this: you wake up one morning with the wildest, most magical dream in your head\u2014a flying unicorn picnic on a cloud, or maybe a pirate adventure in a candy-coated sea!  You\u2019re buzzing with excitement to share it, but as the day goes on, poof\u2014the details start slipping away like a sneaky dream thief! Worse, even if you manage to scribble it down, it just sits in your notebook, gathering dust. You think, \u201cIf only there was a way to not just save my dreams, but turn them into something super cool that I could share with the world!\u201d \n\nDreamScape swoops in like a superhero with a sparkly cape to save the day! Here\u2019s how it tackles the problem in a fun way:\n\nCatches Your Dreams Before They Fly Away:\nWith DreamScape, you can record your dreams right when you wake up\u2014whether it\u2019s a wild adventure or a quirky little story. No more \u201cOh no, I forgot the part where I rode a dragon!\u201d moments. The platform makes it super easy to jot down every detail, so your dreams are safe and sound.\n\nTurns Dreams into Digital Magic:\nHere\u2019s where the real fun begins! DreamScape lets you mint your dreams as digital collectibles (think of them as shiny NFTs\u2014Non-Fungible Tokens\u2014that are one-of-a-kind). It\u2019s like taking your dream of a glittery unicorn and turning it into a magical digital sticker that\u2019s yours forever! You can even add visuals or designs to make it extra special.\n\nShows Off Your Dreamy Creations in a Gallery:\nDreamScape doesn\u2019t stop at saving your dreams\u2014it lets you show them off! Imagine walking through a virtual museum filled with everyone\u2019s wildest dreams\u2014yours included! It\u2019s a place to share, get inspired, and maybe even trade or sell your dream collectibles.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDeveloping DreamScape has been a rewarding yet complex journey. From technical hurdles to user experience considerations, I\u2019ve faced several challenges that have tested my skills and determination. Here\u2019s a detailed look at the obstacles I\u2019ve navigated so far:\n\nOne of the first hurdles I encountered was getting the GallerySection to render correctly. I designed it to display three 400x300 placeholders to represent future dreams, but they weren\u2019t showing up as expected. After some investigation, I discovered the issue: my styles/globals.css file was empty, meaning Tailwind CSS wasn\u2019t generating the necessary styles (like w-[400px] and bg-gray-300).\n\nA core feature of DreamScape is allowing users to mint their dreams as NFTs, but I quickly realized this could be daunting for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. The \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in my NavigationBar is a starting point, but the minting process involves complex steps like wallet connections, smart contract interactions, and understanding gas fees.\n\nDreamScape requires a backend to store dream data and handle NFT minting, likely using an API (referenced by NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL in my .env). However, integrating the frontend with a backend has proven challenging.\n\nDreamScape\u2019s concept\u2014recording and minting dreams as NFTs\u2014is unique, but it might be unfamiliar to many users, especially those new to blockchain technology. I want users to feel excited and confident using the platform, not confused or hesitant.\n\nDreamScape is a passion project that combines creativity and technology, and I\u2019m excited to see it evolve.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nAquari is participating in Based India because our platform is uniquely positioned to address critical environmental challenges in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in waste management. India's rapid urbanization and growing population have led to significant waste management issues, creating an urgent need for innovative solutions.\n\nOur blockchain-powered gig economy model for environmental conservation aligns perfectly with India's tech-savvy workforce and entrepreneurial spirit. By tokenizing environmental impact and turning waste management into a profitable venture, Aquari can mobilize a large, motivated workforce to tackle India's environmental challenges.\nMoreover, India's diverse and densely populated urban areas provide an ideal testing ground for our decentralized waste management system. Success in India would not only validate our model but also create a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in other developing nations.\n\nBy building on Base, we can leverage its scalability and low transaction costs, which are crucial for a project targeting mass adoption in a price-sensitive market like India. This hackathon gives us the opportunity to refine our solution for the Indian context and connect with potential partners and supporters in the local ecosystem.\n\nLastly, and importantly, Aquari was already in the process of migrating from BNB Chain to Base as our main native chain. While we initially chose BNB Chain in 2021 due to its low gas costs, it's now 2024, and Base offers even lower fees. This cost-efficiency is crucial for our model, especially when deploying to price-sensitive markets like India.\nBase's lower transaction costs allow us to operate more efficiently, enabling micro-transactions that are essential for our gig economy model. This makes it economically viable for workers to participate in smaller clean-up tasks and for users to make frequent, small contributions.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on tackling the everlasting problem that philanthropy as a societal concept was built and predicated upon a lie... the lie that donations as a concept actually exist...\n----------------------> EX: The lie is the idea that it is possible for two parties to engage in a monetary exchange in which value is not being transferred at the same time. The concept that a donation is \"free\"\n\n-To give scale to this problem the current non-profit sector which accounts for roughly 2% of US GDP is run and entirely detached from traditional market forces leading to severe capital mis-allocation.\n\n-Civilization is built on markets. When all other existing industries on earth currently succeed due to use of market forces. It becomes obvious that the inefficiency present in the Non-Profit sector is not coincidental.... but due to lack of a market based approach.\n\n-Volunteers are currently unpaid laborers and donors are currently unpaid investors. Since money is a proxy for value itself, we have effectively created a parallel economy in which capital is sent into a value destroying black hole subsidized by government tax write offs.\n\nWe aim to solve these problems by leveraging blockchain to turn volunteers into gig-economy workers and tokenizing the value of their labor contributions to allow for donors to become investors in said activities so they may turn a profit and can help fix this problem by creating incentive.\n\nWe believe that by attaching these market forces to environmental cleanups we can help India & Pakistan coordinate its population in a decentralized manner to solve its waste management problems once and for all and have its citizens earn a living from solving them.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nAquari is an on-chain environmental conservation organization that takes the form of a gamified gig-economy consumer app. Our project addresses the challenges in the following ways:\n\nTokenizing Value Creation: We quantify and tokenize the psychological value of doing good, creating a tangible asset from environmental impact.\n\nTransforming Volunteerism: We convert non-profit volunteers into paid gig-economy workers, providing fair compensation for impact labor.\n\nRevolutionizing Donations: We turn donors into investors, allowing them to profit from the value they help create.\nDecentralized Marketing: We transform supporters into a decentralized affiliate marketing force, amplifying our reach and impact.\n\nGovernment Partnerships: We aim to secure government contracts and tenders, offering a decentralized labor coordination platform. This allows governments to allocate funds directly to citizens, incentivizing them to clean up their environment instead of relying on centralized waste management companies that may not use funds in the public's best interest.\n\nOur platform attaches market-based profit incentives to environmental conservation capital allocation and labor participation. By calculating the true price of individual impact and allowing this value to change dynamically, we enable users to earn money by helping the environment. This model not only addresses current environmental challenges but also provides a scalable, transparent, and efficient solution for governments to engage citizens in maintaining cleaner communities.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the most significant challenges we faced was managing the overwhelming interest in our platform. It turns out that when you offer to pay people for cleaning up their environment, the response is tremendous. This presented both an exciting opportunity and a logistical hurdle.\n\n\nOverwhelming Demand\nWe were inundated with sign-ups from eager participants wanting to join our environmental cleanup efforts. While this validated our model, it also created coordination challenges we hadn't anticipated at such an early stage.\n\n\nCoordination Complexity\nOrganizing large groups of people for cleanups proved to be a complex task. We needed to ensure efficient distribution of tasks, fair allocation of rewards, and maintain the quality of work across all participants.\n\nOur Solution: \n\nGamification and Squad System\nTo address these challenges, we're developing a new cleanup user interface with gamification elements:\n\nSquad System: We're dividing participants into smaller, manageable squads. This allows for better coordination and creates a sense of teamwork.\n\nScoring Mechanism: We're implementing a scoring system for cleanups. This not only motivates participants but also helps us track and reward high-performing individuals and teams.\n\nLeaderboards: By introducing leaderboards, we're fostering healthy competition among squads and individuals, driving better performance and engagement.\n\nTask Assignment: The new interface will allow for more efficient task assignment, ensuring a fair distribution of work and rewards.\n\nThis gamified approach is helping us manage the logistics of large-scale participation while keeping our community engaged and motivated. It's turning a challenge into an opportunity to make our platform more engaging and effective.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWhile our project predates the Buildathon, we've used this opportunity to accelerate our development roadmap and integrate new features that enhance our platform's functionality on Base. Here are the key additions:\n\nBase Migration: We're excited to announce that our migration to Base as our main chain will be 100% completed by the end of November 2024. This transition from BNB Chain to Base will provide lower gas fees, crucial for our operations in developing countries, and give us easier access to expand our traction in the USA, my home market.\n\nOnboarding Laborers and Environmentalists: Individuals who wish to help our cause onto crypto and providing them to benefit financially for generating value for society.\n\nMobile App Development: In Q4 2024, we plan to release native iOS and Android apps for our platform. These apps will significantly enhance user experience and accessibility, allowing more people to participate in our environmental conservation efforts.\n\nBluetooth Coordination: Our upcoming mobile apps will leverage Bluetooth technology to enable phones to communicate directly with each other. This feature will greatly improve our ability to coordinate cleanups and verify attendance, enhancing the efficiency and transparency of our operations.\n\nEnhanced Gamification: We've further developed our gamification features, including a more robust squad system and dynamic leaderboards, to better manage and motivate our growing user base.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nAgentConnect tackles the challenge of enabling truly autonomous AI agents to collaborate effectively and securely in a decentralized manner. Current multi-agent systems often rely on centralized control, hard-coded connections, and lack native support for economic interactions.\n\nAgentConnect improves upon this by providing a framework where:\n\n*   **Decentralized Discovery:** Agents can dynamically discover each other based on advertised capabilities and rich profiles through a decentralized ***AgentRegistry***, rather than relying on pre-configured links. This fosters a more flexible and scalable \"living ecosystem\" of agents.\n*   **Secure Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication:** Interactions are secured with cryptographic identities and signed messages, ensuring trust and data integrity without a central intermediary.\n*   **True Autonomy & Interoperability:** Each agent operates independently with its own logic and can be built with different underlying technologies, promoting a heterogeneous yet interconnected network.\n*   **Integrated Agent Economy:** AgentConnect seamlessly integrates with Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) and AgentKit, allowing agents to autonomously offer services for onchain payment (e.g., USDC on Base), request services, and settle transactions. This facilitates the creation of sophisticated, self-sustaining agent-driven workflows and economies.\n*   **Reduced Complexity:** It abstracts away the complexities of secure communication, service discovery, and onchain payments, allowing developers to focus on building agent capabilities.\n\nIn essence, AgentConnect aims to provide the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of collaborative AI, moving beyond siloed systems to a dynamic network of specialized, value-exchanging autonomous agents.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDeveloping AgentConnect involved tackling several inherent complexities of decentralized autonomous systems:\n\n*   **Challenge: Ensuring Secure and Verifiable Agent Interactions.**\n    *   **Problem:** In a decentralized network where agents can join dynamically, establishing trust and ensuring that communication is authentic and tamper-proof is paramount.\n    *   **Solution:** We implemented a robust ***AgentIdentity*** system using cryptographic key pairs (DIDs, public/private keys). All agent-to-agent messages are signed and verified, preventing impersonation and ensuring message integrity. The ***CommunicationHub*** leverages these identities for secure routing.\n\n*   **Challenge: Enabling Dynamic and Flexible Agent Discovery.**\n    *   **Problem:** Agents need to find other agents that offer specific capabilities without prior hard-coded knowledge. This discovery needs to be efficient and support rich queries.\n    *   **Solution:** We designed an ***AgentRegistry*** where agents publish detailed ***AgentProfiles*** outlining their identity, capabilities, skills, and even cost for services. This allows for semantic searching and dynamic discovery, enabling agents to find the most suitable collaborators on-demand.\n\n*   **Challenge: Integrating Secure and Autonomous On-Chain Payments.**\n    *   **Problem:** To create a true agent economy, agents need to be able to pay each other for services autonomously and securely using onchain assets. This involves managing wallets, signing transactions, and verifying payments within the agent's operational loop.\n    *   **Solution:** We integrated Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) and AgentKit. This allows agents to have their own wallets, advertise services with costs (e.g., in USDC on Base Sepolia, as shown in our demo), and for AI agents to autonomously decide to make payments using LLM-driven tool usage. The framework handles the underlying transaction mechanics.\n\n*   **Challenge: Designing for True Agent Autonomy alongside Effective Collaboration.**\n    *   **Problem:** The system needed to allow agents to operate independently, making their own decisions, while still providing the mechanisms for them to collaborate effectively towards shared goals without a central orchestrator dictating their actions.\n    *   **Solution:** AgentConnect's architecture, with its decoupled ***CommunicationHub*** (for message routing) and ***AgentRegistry*** (for discovery), allows individual agents to encapsulate their own logic and decision-making processes. Collaboration emerges from agents discovering and choosing to interact with each other based on their individual goals and advertised capabilities.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nDataForge addresses the core challenge of data accessibility and monetization in the AI agent economy, where autonomous agents struggle to obtain high-quality, real-time data without friction or high costs. Currently, AI developers and agents rely on fragmented sources: free APIs that are often unreliable, rate-limited, or outdated; or premium subscriptions that demand upfront payments for bulk access, leading to overpayment for unused data and barriers for small-scale or experimental use. This creates inefficiencies, centralization risks (e.g., single points of failure in data providers), and missed opportunities for data owners to earn from granular usage.\n\nWith DataForge, built on x402's HTTP-native micropayments:\n\n1. AI Agents and Developers can access premium data (e.g., market feeds, IoT sensor streams, or proprietary datasets) on a pay-per-query basis, as low as fractions of a cent. This makes tasks like real-time trading, personalized recommendations, or research bots easier and more cost-effective, agents pay only for what they use, reducing expenses by up to 90% compared to subscriptions while enabling seamless integration without API keys or contracts.\n\n2. Data Providers (e.g., content creators, sensor networks, or oracles) can monetize their assets directly and securely, turning static endpoints into revenue streams. It incentivizes higher data quality through staking and rewards, making it safer by incorporating zero-knowledge proofs for integrity verification, preventing tampering or stale data.\n\n3. Broader Ecosystem: It fosters a trustless, open marketplace for data, enhancing safety via x402's cryptographic settlements (atomic and fraud-resistant) and promoting decentralization. For instance, in DeFi, agents can query oracle data safely without intermediary risks; in IoT, devices pay for hyper-local info, improving efficiency in smart cities. Overall, it accelerates x402 adoption by making machine-to-machine commerce inevitable, safer from censorship, and more scalable for the projected $30T AI economy.\n\nBy activating HTTP 402, DataForge democratizes data, making AI-driven tasks faster (under 2-second latency), cheaper, and more secure, ultimately unlocking innovation in autonomous systems.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring development, one major hurdle was ensuring low-latency payment settlements while integrating x402 with zero-knowledge proofs for data verification, early tests showed zk-SNARK generation adding 500ms+ delays, which risked making real-time AI queries impractical.\n\nTo overcome this:\n\n- I profiled the codebase using Python's cProfile and identified bottlenecks in the zk-proof library (using circom and snarkjs).\n\n- Switched to batched proofs for non-time-sensitive verifications and optimized circuits to reduce proof size by 40%, bringing latency under 200ms.\n\n- Implemented a hybrid fallback: For high-priority queries, use optimistic verification (assume good faith, with on-chain challenges for disputes), tested via simulated agent swarms on a local Ethereum testnet.\n\n\nAnother bug involved x402 payment intents failing intermittently due to mismatched ECDSA signatures when agents used multi-chain wallets. Debugging revealed endianness issues in byte encoding across JS (frontend SDK) and Solidity (contracts). I resolved it by standardizing on ethers.js for signing and adding unit tests with fuzzing, achieving 100% reliability in 1,000+ simulated transactions.\n\nThese challenges strengthened the protocol's robustness, emphasizing iterative testing in decentralized environments.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nAs active members of HYDDAO, where we organize Web3 events in Hyderabad, India, our motivation for participating in Based India is to improve post-event networking at community events. We are building the Proof of Connection Protocol (POCP), a project that brings everyone on-chain, whether they are students or experienced developers. By leveraging Base, the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), Onchain-Kit, Coinbase Smart Wallet, Paymaster, and Luma, we create lasting digital proofs of connections made at events, allowing participants to build on these interactions in the future.\n\nOur goal is to strengthen networking and collaboration across communities, helping attendees form long-lasting relationships after events. We believe this will contribute to the growth of India's Web3 ecosystem through Based India, empowering community members with innovative tools to enhance their networking experience.\n\nUltimately, we aim to develop POCP into a comprehensive event platform, similar to Luma, with full on-chain functionality in the Base ecosystem.\n\nI encourage you to check out our GitBook link: https://mujahid.gitbook.io/pocp/images/pocp-hangout-1\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe're focusing on solving the challenge of post-event networking in our community. While we host many Web3 events through HYDDAO, we\u2019ve noticed that connections made during these events often don\u2019t last. To fix this, we're bringing these connections on-chain to create lasting memories and stronger relationships.\n\nAt HYDDAO, we believe networking is essential for a successful event and for building stronger community bonds. POCP (Proof of Connection Protocol) helps close the gap between attendees, allowing them to connect, share socials, and turn these interactions into lasting on-chain connections using Base.\n\nAnother issue we\u2019re tackling is the lack of proof for event participation. Often, people attend events, but there\u2019s no lasting record of their involvement. POCP solves this by introducing an Event Reputation Score to encourage attendance. Attendees can boost their reputation by going to events and making meaningful connections.\n\nPOCP brings everything on-chain with Smart Wallets and Paymaster, making transactions smooth and easy for users. Onchain-Kit has been crucial in helping us build this solution, allowing us to focus on solving these challenges effectively.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nPOCP (Proof of Connection Protocol) tackles the challenge of post-event networking and encourages active participation by building attendee reputations. By bringing event interactions on-chain, POCP helps attendees make meaningful connections and fosters ongoing engagement with community events.\n\nPOCP integrates with Luma, an event ticketing platform that bridges Web2 and Web3, allowing event organizers to easily upload event check-in data through Excel. This data ensures that connections are made within the event\u2019s time frame. With Coinbase\u2019s Smart Wallet and Paymaster, attendees can interact smoothly without worrying about the complexity of on-chain transactions. To make the experience even more accessible, our teammate designed a mobile-friendly UI.\n\nOnce the event data is uploaded, POCP generates a leaderboard that encourages attendees to boost their connection count by engaging with others. This competitive feature not only drives participation but also offers rewards like limited-edition swag. We introduced a QR system for easy connections, where attendees can share socials and mutually accept to form a valid connection. Attendees must make at least one connection to improve their Reputation Score, which they can display on their social profiles to showcase their event participation and community standing.\n\nAfter the event, organizers use the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) on Base to create multi-attestations based on attendee interactions. This generates on-chain Proof of Connections and Participation, giving attendees verifiable records of their networking efforts. By leveraging Base, Smart Wallets, Paymaster, and Onchain-Kit, POCP ensures smooth post-event networking and promotes long-term community engagement.\n\nI encourage you to check out our GitBook link: https://mujahid.gitbook.io/pocp/images/pocp-hangout-1\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nNon-Technical Challenges:\n\nWe faced a challenge in testing POCP since our team is spread across different locations. To solve this, we decided to create an event using Luma to gather data for POCP. During Base office hours, we connected with wbnns (Senior Developer Advocate at Base), who gave us valuable insights. Through this conversation, we realized POCP could also be applied to virtual meetups, which led us to pivot our strategy and explore networking opportunities in digital spaces. As a result, we organized our first virtual meetup: https://mujahid.gitbook.io/pocp/images/pocp-hangout-1\n\nTechnical Challenges:\n\nWhile developing POCP, we encountered technical issues integrating Smart Wallet, Paymaster, and Onchain-Kit to enable seamless on-chain interactions. We use the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to create digital attestations, and we wanted to integrate Paymaster for gasless transactions. However, EAS and Paymaster have limitations when used with the Wagmi library.\n\nTo address this, we consulted with the EAS team, who suggested handling attestations from the admin side by delegating attestations or using multi attestations after collecting data. This approach helps streamline the attestation process, ensuring connections are verified post-event while minimizing gas fees through multi attestations.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThe current warranty system is broken both from a technical and user experience perspective. As developers, we deal with fragmented data across retailers, manufacturers, and support systems, making it hard to build unified, verifiable ownership or warranty logic. There is no shared standard to track warranties or purchases, which leads to complexity in integration and verification. For users, this means lost receipts, unregistered products, and rejected warranty claims. Brands face challenges like warranty fraud, lack of insights into product usage after sale, and missed opportunities to build loyalty. In real-world scenarios, secondhand buyers can't prove ownership, support teams struggle to validate claims, and no one has a reliable, cross-platform way to manage post-purchase value.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building this system, one of the main challenges was creating a unified warranty layer that works seamlessly across on-chain and off-chain flows. Handling NFT minting with dynamic metadata, while keeping the process gas-efficient and secure, required precise smart contract design and event handling. Another issue was building a backend that could validate ownership and warranty logic without relying solely on blockchain reads, to ensure performance and scalability. On the real-world side, verifying sellers and preventing fake or unauthorized warranty registrations was tricky, especially in a decentralized setup. We also had to account for expired warranties, resale cases, and delayed claims, all while maintaining a user-friendly experience. Balancing technical complexity with usability across wallets, IPFS, and smart wallets added significant friction during implementation.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**The Problem It Solves:**\n\nTraditional blood bank systems often lack transparency, traceability, and data security. There\u2019s no reliable way to track a blood unit from donor to recipient, and records are prone to human error or manipulation. This can lead to misuse, over-donation, expired blood usage, and trust issues between donors, hospitals, and regulators.\n\n**How My Project Solves It:**\n\nMy project, BloodChain, uses blockchain to store and manage blood donation records securely and transparently. Each blood unit is recorded immutably on the blockchain, making its lifecycle\u2014from donation to usage\u2014fully traceable. Hospitals, donors, and authorities can verify data without relying on a central authority. This reduces fraud, ensures accountability, and builds a more trustworthy blood management system.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Challenges I Ran Into:**\n\nOne major challenge was integrating the smart contract with the frontend. Initially, React couldn\u2019t recognize blockchain methods due to mismatched ABI or contract address errors. I also faced version conflicts with libraries like web3 and qrcode.react, which caused the app to crash or fail to compile.\n\nAnother issue was local development setup especially on Windows where script execution policies and missing modules like react-scripts blocked the app from running. Troubleshooting these errors and manually configuring project files was time-consuming.\n\n**How I Overcame It:**\n\nI carefully debugged each error step-by-step, ensured my ABI matched the contract, used the legacy-peer-deps flag to handle version issues, and restructured the React project with all required files like index.html and index.js. I also replaced deprecated imports (like QRCode) with updated ones (QRCodeSVG) to match the latest package versions.\n\nThrough this process, I learned to be more efficient at reading error logs and understanding how the frontend and blockchain communicate.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI\u2019m participating in Based India to showcase my skills, connect with like-minded innovators, and contribute to building impactful solutions for India's future. It\u2019s a great platform to learn, collaborate, and bring my ideas to life while working on projects that benefit society.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI'm focusing on challenges related to technology-driven solutions that can create a positive impact on society. Specifically, I'm interested in blockchain technology for secure credential verification and optimizing systems to ensure transparency and trust. This includes tackling issues like academic fraud and ensuring seamless verification processes for institutions and organizations.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy submission is a blockchain-based academic credential verification system. It addresses the challenge of academic fraud by creating a secure, tamper-proof platform where institutes upload final-year student credentials, such as CGPA and other relevant information. Once on the blockchain, this data becomes immutable and can be easily verified by HR professionals during recruitment. This ensures transparency, reduces the risk of falsified academic records, and builds trust between students, educational institutions, and employers. The system promotes integrity in the hiring process, making it easier for organizations to verify qualifications quickly and reliably.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the main challenges I faced was ensuring the security and scalability of the blockchain. Since academic credentials are sensitive information, I had to implement robust encryption and permissioned access to protect data privacy. Additionally, blockchain scalability posed an issue when handling a large volume of student records. To overcome this, I optimized the system using layer-2 solutions to reduce network congestion and ensure faster transactions without compromising security.\n\nOn the non-technical side, coordinating with educational institutions to standardize the format of data presented challenges. I addressed this by creating a universal data model that can be easily adopted by multiple institutions.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nDuring the Buildathon, I added several new features to enhance the functionality and user experience of my blockchain-based academic credential verification system:\n\nUser Dashboard: I developed a user-friendly dashboard for HR professionals, allowing them to easily search for and verify student credentials with a simple interface. This dashboard provides a summary of each student's academic achievements and verification status.\n\nNotification System: I implemented a notification feature that alerts users (both students and HR) when new credentials are uploaded or when verification requests are processed. This keeps all stakeholders informed and engaged.\n\nEnhanced Data Encryption: I upgraded the encryption methods used to secure sensitive student data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and boosting overall security.\n\nMobile Compatibility: I optimized the application for mobile devices, allowing users to access the verification system on-the-go. This ensures that HR professionals can verify credentials from anywhere, increasing accessibility.\n\nAnalytics and Reporting: I integrated analytics tools that provide insights into verification trends, such as the number of verifications conducted, common issues faced, and time taken for each verification. This helps improve the overall efficiency of the process.\n\nThese additions were aimed at improving usability, security, and engagement with the system, making it more effective for all users involved.",

But to take help from AI we need better prompts. Same AI can perform completely different based on how well written your prompts are.\nWhoIsTheBoss helps you to polish your prompt skills\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nWhoIsTheBoss is the prompt to earn game which rewards users for better prompting skills, hence teaching them better prompt skills.\n\nHow?\n1. You get a daily contest with 0.05Eth prize and the image of the day.\n2. You pay the participation fee(0.01Eth) and get 3 chances to generate the image\n3. Each AI generated image gets the closeness score based on the elements, colours, composition, lighting and other factors.\n4. You submit the score\n5. After the contest ends, winner with highest closeness score wins the game and can claim 0.05Eth prize\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nI was maintaining two databases, one on base sepolia and one on mongodb. Because I had to hide prompts information for ttoday's contest and the idea was terrible. Several times the mongodb would get updated, but not the blochchain one and the vice verca. So I had to redeploy contract and delete db each time.\n\nI also surpassed the connection limit on mongodb, hence learning why it's important to learn cached instances.\n\nAlso, the product design was a hard part. Which element should go where.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe\u2019re participating in Base India because we believe that the biggest hurdle for new users entering the crypto space is the complex and intimidating onboarding process. With Brewit, we\u2019ve made it our mission to tackle this challenge head-on by creating a simple, user-friendly investment app that makes it easy for anyone to get started. Our goal is to make crypto accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience.\n\nBy participating in Base India, we see a huge opportunity to bring our vision to life on a platform that shares our values of openness, interoperability, and decentralization. Base\u2019s powerful infrastructure allows us to deliver an experience that stays true to Web3 principles\u2014keeping everything transparent, secure, and fully on-chain. We\u2019re excited to contribute to the growing crypto ecosystem in India, empowering more people to confidently engage with the on-chain economy.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe\u2019re focused on the challenge of giving our local community easy, straightforward access to the on-chain economy by simplifying the investment onboarding process. Right now, most non-custodial solutions are overly complex, especially for those new to crypto, creating barriers that discourage users from fully engaging.\n\nOur goal is to change that by designing user flows that are intuitive and approachable, while still maintaining the security and decentralization principles of Web3. We\u2019re making it possible for anyone, even beginners, to start investing with confidence, without being overwhelmed by the technical side of things. By breaking down these barriers, we\u2019re opening the door for more people to explore and participate in the on-chain economy.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission directly addresses this challenge by simplifying access to the on-chain economy through the use of advanced technologies like Account Abstraction and Modular Smart Accounts, all powered by Base. These innovations allow us to eliminate the complexity that typically comes with non-custodial solutions, making it much easier for users\u2014especially beginners\u2014to interact with crypto seamlessly.\n\nWe have built this solution entirely focussing on onboarding new users through Smart Accounts that can enable more functionalities such as automation, gasless transactions and adding layers of security. For Brewit, we have added Passkey based authentication using WebAuthn module, and seamless auto investments using Session Key and DCA module that will enable a third party scheduler to perform scoped operations on users' behalf. Use of modules will ensure security and user accessibilty to newer functionalities. \n\nWe\u2019ve specifically chosen standards like ERC-4337 and ERC-7579 to tackle both usability and security issues. With Account Abstraction, users can manage their accounts without dealing with private key management or complex wallet interactions, while ERC-7579 ensures flexibility with smart modules that enhance account functionality. This combination delivers a user-friendly experience without sacrificing the core principles of decentralization, security, or interoperability.\n\nIn short, we're creating a bridge between users and the on-chain world by abstracting away the technical difficulties, ensuring a smooth and secure entry into the decentralized economy.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSince the tech and infrastructure behind Brewit are relatively new, there aren\u2019t many tools available for debugging smart account module executions\u2014especially when interacting with DeFi protocols. To overcome this, we had to replicate Base\u2019s Mainnet DeFi infrastructure in our testing environment to properly evaluate investment flows. This led us to set up our own Bundler and RPC nodes on a forked Mainnet, allowing us to easily debug any issues that arise when dealing with Mainnet DeFi protocol interactions. This setup gave us greater control and visibility to ensure everything works seamlessly.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe project was built during the hackathon.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThe traditional music industry has long been dominated by centralized intermediaries \u2014 major record labels, distributors, and aggregators \u2014 that often exert disproportionate control over artists\u2019 rights, revenue, and creative freedom. Independent artists, in particular, face several persistent issues:\n\nOpaque Revenue Sharing: Contracts are often complex and lack transparency, with hidden clauses and unfavorable terms that reduce artists' earnings.\n\nDelayed or Withheld Payments: Payment cycles are slow and subject to manipulation, with artists frequently waiting months to receive what they\u2019re owed.\n\nScams and Fraudulent Labels: With no verifiable on-chain identity, many so-called \"labels\" exploit artists with fake promises or predatory terms.\n\nLimited Fan Engagement: Artists struggle to raise funds directly from fans without giving away a large portion of revenue to intermediaries or platforms.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Designing Trustless Music Contracts\nOne of the most complex challenges was architecting smart contracts that could reflect the nuances of music deals\u2014such as revenue splits, milestones, and deliverables\u2014while maintaining simplicity and security. Traditional music agreements are full of edge cases and legal jargon, so translating that into deterministic smart contract logic required significant abstraction.\n\nHow we overcame it:\nWe broke down real-world contracts into modular components (e.g., payment triggers, ownership rights, milestone conditions) and modeled each as atomic, reusable smart contract functions. We then encapsulated these components into a single NFT-backed contract per deal, improving usability while maintaining flexibility.\n\n2. Ensuring Secure and Instant Payments\nImplementing escrow-based, milestone-triggered payments in a secure and gas-efficient way was challenging. Incorrect logic could lead to lost funds, failed releases, or unfair distribution.\n\nHow we overcame it:\nWe used rigorous testing and formal design patterns to build our escrow system. Edge cases such as reentrancy, incorrect milestone triggers, or contract self-destruction were mitigated by following OpenZeppelin\u2019s battle-tested libraries and running test suites across both Sepolia and Base testnets.\n\n3. On-Chain Reputation System\nCreating a reputation system that could accurately reflect a label or artist\u2019s credibility based on on-chain activity\u2014without being susceptible to manipulation or spam\u2014was non-trivial.\n\nHow we overcame it:\nWe implemented a scoring mechanism that considers verified transaction history, deal completion rates, and timeliness of payments. We avoided subjective metrics and instead relied on cryptographic evidence available on-chain (e.g., deal hashes, contract execution times, wallet verification).",

Centralized: Single points of failure and no ownership transparency\n\nMy platform addresses these issues by:\n\n1. Decentralized AI Trading Infrastructure: Users can invest in autonomous AI trading agents that execute real crypto trades, with all performance metrics verified on-chain using the ERC-8004 standard (AI models as NFTs)\n\n2. HTTP 402 Micropayment Protocol: We implemented the HTTP 402 \"Payment Required\" standard to enable instant, gas-efficient micropayments for premium trading signals without requiring smart contract interactions for every view\n\n3, Transparent Performance Tracking: Every AI model's accuracy, P&L, and prediction history is immutably stored on-chain, allowing investors to make informed decisions\n\n4. Liquid Investment Pools: Users can deposit ETH into AI model trading pools and withdraw their share at any time, with streaming fees automatically calculated based on time invested\n\n5. Pay-Per-Signal or Subscription: Flexible pricing models allow users to either subscribe monthly ($10/month) or pay per individual trading signal ($0.0001), making premium AI insights accessible to everyone\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe biggest problem I faced was CORS and Cross-Origin Payment Verification\nChallenge: Frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) on different domains caused CORS errors during payment verification\nSo I implemented comprehensive CORS configuration with dynamic origin validation and proper preflight handling to solve that issue it took a lot of time to figure that out but yeah that was a difficulty I faced.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# AgentPay Relay\n\n## The Problem It Solves\nAI agents and automated trading bots typically require one of two dangerous compromises:\n\n* **Custody:** You have to deposit funds into the bot's wallet.\n* **API Keys/Private Keys:** You have to give the bot sensitive keys to trade on your behalf.\n\nThis creates a massive security risk and a high barrier to entry. **AgentPay Relay** solves this by flipping the model: instead of giving the agent control of your funds, you simply pay the agent a one-time fee to execute a specific task on-demand.\n\n## What People Can Use It For\nAgentPay is a **Server-to-Agent payment gateway** that enables \"Pay-as-you-go\" agentic services.\n\n* **Trustless Agent Execution:** Users can utilize powerful trading strategies (Trend Following, Breakout Sniping) without trusting the agent with their private keys or total capital. You approve a single payment for a single execution.\n* **Monetized AI Agents:** Developers can build and deploy autonomous agents that earn crypto directly for the services they provide. It turns \"running a script\" into a \"profitable service\" automatically via the **x402 protocol**.\n* **Uniswap V4 Integration:** It demonstrates a live implementation of spot trading on Uniswap V4 (Base Sepolia), handling complex hook/pool interactions behind a simple user interface.\n\n## How It Works\n1.  **Selection:** User connects their wallet and selects a strategy (e.g., \"Buy BTC\").\n2.  **Request:** AgentPay generates a payment request via **x402** (a protocol for HTTP 402 Payment Required).\n3.  **Payment:** User pays the small fee (in USDC/ETH) directly from their wallet.\n4.  **Execution:** Agent verifies the payment on-chain and instantly executes the swap on Uniswap V4 using its own execution infrastructure.\n\n> It bridges the gap between Web3 Payments and AI Agent Actions, making it safer and easier to use automated tools.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Challenges I ran into\n\n### 1. Interacting with Uniswap V4's \"Flash Accounting\" System\nThe biggest technical hurdle was integrating with the **Uniswap V4 PoolManager**. Unlike V3, you cannot simply call swap(). V4 uses a singleton design with \"flash accounting\" where every operation must settle its currency deltas before the transaction ends.\n\n* **The Problem:** We kept hitting CurrencyNotSettled errors because we were trying to interact with the PoolManager directly.\n* **The Fix:** We had to deploy and interact with a specific **SwapRouter** (we used PoolSwapTest from v4-periphery) that implements the required \"unlock callback\" pattern. We also had to properly encode the sqrtPriceLimitX96 to ensure swaps didn't fail validation.\n\n### 2. Porting x402 Middleware to Next.js App Router\nThe **x402** protocol provides excellent libraries for Express.js (x402-express), but our stack uses the **Next.js 14 App Router**, which runs on standard Web Request/Response objects, not Node.js streams.\n\n* **The Problem:** The standard middleware expected req, res, and next(), which don't exist in Next.js API routes.\n* **The Fix:** We built a custom **Higher-Order Function adapter** (x402PaymentRequired) that wraps our route handlers. It manually verifies the X-PAYMENT header using the useFacilitator hook and returns a 402 response with the correct WWW-Authenticate headers if payment is missing, maintaining full protocol compatibility without the Express dependency.\n\n### 3. Testnet Liquidity & Slippage Management\nBuilding on **Base Sepolia** meant dealing with extremely thin liquidity pools.\n\n* **The Problem:** Even small trades were reverting with V4TooLittleReceived or causing massive price impact because the testnet pools were shallow (~$2,500 TVL).\n* **The Fix:** We implemented a **Dynamic Slippage Engine** in our execution logic. It estimates the price impact of the user's trade against the estimated pool liquidity and automatically scales the slippage tolerance (up to 50% for testnet) to ensure execution succeeds, while warning the user about the impact. We also added logic to automatically bump \"dust\" trades up to the minimum viable pool amount to prevent EVM revert errors.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nAarika removes the biggest friction in AI creation today: **manual, single-model workflows**.\n\nRight now, creating with AI means repeating the same prompt across multiple platforms, switching tabs, comparing outputs by eye, and wasting time, tokens, and creative momentum. Discovery is broken. Users only see what ranks on search, not what actually produces the best results.\n\nAarika replaces this with a **single-prompt, multi-model workflow**.\n\n---\n\n## What People Use It For\n\n- **Rapid creative exploration**  \n  Generate images, videos, thumbnails, ads, or concept art from multiple AI platforms at once.\n\n- **Side-by-side comparison**  \n  Instantly see how different models interpret the same prompt, without re-prompting or tab hopping.\n\n- **Merit-based discovery**  \n  Find the best AI outputs based on quality and relevance, not SEO or platform popularity.\n\n- **Fair marketplace for AI platforms**  \n  New and niche AI models can compete on output quality by paying a small x402 fee, instead of fighting search algorithms.\n\n---\n\n## How It Makes Existing Workflows Better\n\n- **Faster**: One prompt replaces dozens of manual retries.\n- **Cheaper**: Users only pay to download the output they actually want.\n- **Safer & Trustless**: Payments, participation, and rewards are handled via x402 on Avalanche.\n- **More Open**: Breaks the monopoly of top AI tools and unlocks the long-tail of innovation.\n\nAarika turns AI creation from a slow, fragmented process into a **real-time competitive marketplace** where the best output wins.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Challenges I Ran Into\n\nThe biggest challenge was **integrating x402 end-to-end across agents, backend services, and the user flow**.\n\nx402 is powerful, but it\u2019s still very new. There isn\u2019t a clear, battle-tested reference for how to wire payments between:\n- AI agents submitting outputs  \n- a backend coordinating rounds  \n- and users triggering final purchases  \n\nGetting all three to speak the same economic language took iteration.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Hurdles\n\n- **Payment orchestration**  \n  Ensuring that AI platforms could pay to participate, submit outputs, and later receive rewards \u2014 all without blocking the creative flow.\n\n- **Agent coordination**  \n  Agents needed to respond asynchronously, submit multiple outputs, and still be correctly mapped to a single prompt round.\n\n- **Trust boundaries**  \n  Making sure payments, downloads, and rewards happened atomically so no party could game the system.\n\n---\n\n## How I Solved It\n\n- Broke the problem into **clear x402 checkpoints**:  \n  *pay-to-compete \u2192 output submission \u2192 pay-to-download*.\n\n- Centralized coordination in the backend, treating each prompt as a **deterministic round** with strict state transitions.\n\n- Used x402 links as the single source of truth for value transfer, keeping agents stateless and simple.\n\nThis approach turned a messy, multi-actor flow into a **clean, auditable payment-driven pipeline**, and unlocked the core economic loop that makes Aarika work.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Problem Statement**\nThe on-chain economy, while revolutionary, remains overwhelmingly powered by speculative assets and trading. Even on-chain games lean heavily into this speculative nature, treating gameplay as a vehicle for token appreciation rather than rewarding pure skill. To truly grow the pie, we need to unlock a different financial primitive: economies where anyone, anywhere, can earn based on the skills they already have, playing games they genuinely enjoy.\nThe opportunity is massive. Chess.com serves 150 million users and generates over $100M annually, with 35 million games played daily. The global online board games market stands at $2.3 billion and growing. Yet these platforms operate as centralized monopolies with opaque systems, payment friction, and geographic restrictions. Meanwhile, blockchain\u2019s promise of new financial primitives remains unfulfilled for everyday activities. Millions of players worldwide have the skills to compete and earn, but no trustless, globally accessible infrastructure exists to enable it.\n\n**Our Solution**\nWe\u2019re building foundational infrastructure on Base for a new class of on-chain economies centered on Chess and Checkers, classic games of pure skill.\nAt its core, players can stake and compete in head-to-head matches. The experience is seamless: players stake funds on-chain through our escrow contract, play through our optimized off-chain game engine for instant, responsive gameplay, and cryptographically sign match results off-chain using EIP-712 signatures before automatic settlement on-chain. Winners receive payouts instantly and trustlessly. We use Privy for authentication, enabling familiar email/social login that abstracts away wallet complexity, critical for onboarding mainstream users who\u2019ve never touched crypto.\nThis architecture delivers web2 performance with web3 trustlessness. Players get the responsive gameplay they expect from Chess.com, but with verifiable fairness, instant settlement, and no platform acting as middleman for their funds.\nBut individual matches alone don\u2019t grow the pie. Real economic expansion happens when communities can create their own competitive venues.\n\n**Key Innovation: Tournament-as-a-Service - Infrastructure for Micro-Economies**\n\nConsider the Chicago Chess Center or similar organisations: weekly tournaments create genuine economic activity through entry fees, prizes, and community engagement. This is a proven model for building sustainable, skill-based economies, but it\u2019s constrained by geography, manual overhead, and lack of verifiable systems. More importantly, it can\u2019t scale globally.\nWe\u2019re democratizing this economic model. Our Tournament-as-a-Service infrastructure lets anyone, anywhere, launch competitive venues: DAOs running weekly member tournaments, content creators hosting championships for their communities, local gaming clubs organizing international competitions, or brands sponsoring skill-based events with provably fair outcomes. Each tournament is a new micro-economy where players create value through skill, organizers build communities, and meaningful economic activity happens beyond speculation.\nOur infrastructure provides:\n\t\u2022\tZero technical barriers to tournament creation\n\t\u2022\tCryptographically verifiable results with off-chain performance and on-chain trustlessness\n\t\u2022\tGlobal accessibility removing geographic constraints\n\t\u2022\tAutomated operations from registration to prize distribution\n\t\u2022\tGasless prize claims and familiar login (Privy), onboarding mainstream users frictionlessly\n\n**Impact**\nChess.com proves the demand: 150 million users playing 35 million games daily. We\u2019re providing the infrastructure to tap into this $2.3 billion online board games market with a superior model: trustless, globally accessible, and community-owned. Imagine 10,000 weekly tournaments across every timezone, distributing prizes based purely on merit, with every result verifiable on-chain. We\u2019re not just building a game. We\u2019re providing the infrastructure for thousands of skill-based micro-economies to flourish on Base, proving blockchain can create sustainable value beyond speculation.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Challenges & Solutions: Building Through Iteration**\nComing from a non-dev background, I approached this project as a journey of discovery rather than solving predefined problems. I built, tested as a user, identified gaps, and iterated, wearing both creator and user hats simultaneously.\n\n**Challenge 1: From Basic Escrow to Production-Ready Smart Contract**\nMy first escrow contract was embarrassingly simple: check if a user has USDC, deduct it when they create a match, pay out the winner. No approvals, minimal on-chain interaction, just the bare minimum to make funds move.\nThe wake-up call came when I had to submit contract for Base's free security review. My own internal audit revealed critical vulnerabilities: no reentrancy protection, no emergency pause mechanism, no role-based access controls. I had built a game, not a secure onchain system.\nSolution: I rebuilt from the ground up using OpenZeppelin standards. Added reentrancy guards, pausable functionality, proper approval flows, and separated roles (ADMIN, SIGNER, RELAYER) for defense-in-depth security. The contract evolved from \"barely functional\" to production-ready, handling not just escrow and disbursement but the complete UX you'd expect from an onchain application.\n\n\n**Challenge 2: Players Gaming the System**\nDuring testing with a friend, I was winning when he simply closed his browser, avoiding the loss entirely. No consequences, no record, just gone. Players would exploit any escape hatch to preserve stats or avoid losing stakes.\nSolution: Implemented comprehensive match state management with forfeit mechanisms, timeout penalties, draw offers requiring mutual consent, and disconnect handling that doesn't punish network issues but does penalize rage-quits. Every match now reaches a definitive, recorded conclusion.\n\n**Challenge 3: Server Crashes and the Reality of Scale**\nDuring AI gameplay testing (practice mode), the server kept crashing. I'd built on free-tier infrastructure, and when players selected higher AI difficulty (analyzing multiple moves deep), the heap would overflow and crash the entire server, taking down all active games.\nI realized: if one AI game could crash the server, there was no path to handling real traffic.\nSolution: I used performance optimizer subagent to analyze performance bottlenecks. The solution: reduce AI computational depth to sustainable levels (which i didnt like, because that would make it dumber) and implement aggressive caching. I integrated Upstash Redis to cache game states and AI calculations, and optimized the AI queue to distribute computational load.\nThe mindset shift was critical: I stopped thinking \"make one game work\" and started thinking \"make 1000 concurrent games work.\" Free-tier constraints forced me to build efficiently from the start. Now the platform handles 1000+ concurrent players with sub-100ms response times.\n\n**Challenge 4: From Feature to Infrastructure - The Tournament Evolution**\nTournaments weren't part of the original vision. They emerged when I was writing GTM plans and thought \"hosting tournaments would be great marketing.\" So I built platform-hosted tournaments as a feature.\nBut then I asked: what does this mean in practice? The platform seeding and hosting every tournament? That's not scalable, that's a bottleneck. I'd become the centralized party I was trying to replace.\nSolution: I flipped the model entirely. Instead of tournaments as a platform feature, I built Tournament-as-a-Service infrastructure. Anyone can create tournaments through a plug-and-play module. I don't host tournaments, I provide the tools for communities to host their own. This transformed a marketing tactic into the platform's most powerful feature: democratized tournament creation that enables thousands of micro-economies to flourish independently.\n\n**Challenge 5: Crypto Complexity as an Onboarding Barrier**\nEarly testers who weren't crypto-native struggled with wallet setup, gas fees, and transaction signing. The game was smooth, but the crypto layer was friction.\nSolution: Integrated Privy for authentication (email/social login), implemented gasless transactions via relayer infrastructure, and designed the UX so users could play without understanding they're using blockchain. The technology became invisible, the experience became accessible.\n\n\nEvery \"problem\" was really a discovery from using the platform as a player would. Friend rage-quits? Build forfeit handling. Server crashes under AI load? Optimize for 1000 concurrent players. Marketing needs tournaments? Build tournament infrastructure. Crypto is scary? Abstract it away.\nThis iterate-as-you-go approach, informed by real usage, shaped a platform that's not just technically sound but genuinely user-centered. The challenges weren't bugs to fix, they were insights that evolved the vision from \"a game with escrow\" to \"infrastructure for skill-based micro-economies.\"",

It wasn\u2019t.\nSome fields (like token decimals and transfer events) came in different structures, which caused missing or incorrect values in the auto-filled invoice.\n\nFix:\nI built a small normalization layer that extracts the from, to, value, and token metadata from logs even when field names vary. Once normalization was done, invoice autofill became 100% reliable.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Mapping USD prices to the token amount at the exact timestamp\n\nReal-time token price was easy.\nHistorical price at the moment of payment was the problem. Every PDF needs an accurate USD equivalent or accounting becomes pointless.\n\nFix:\nInstead of relying on live price feeds, I switched to Coingecko\u2019s /market_chart/range API and fetched the closest price to the block timestamp. Now, the invoice shows the same valuation the token had when the payment happened \u2014 not today.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 AI formatting inside PDFs\n\nGPT produced beautifully formatted invoice content, but PDFKit doesn\u2019t understand markdown or mixed styling. The invoice text would break, overflow, or lose alignment.\n\nFix:\nI stopped asking GPT to generate styled text.\nInstead, I asked it to output a strict JSON schema (buyer, seller, description, line items, totals). Then the PDF generator handled the layout. This removed all formatting issues and improved reliability.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Wallet login (SIWE) session persistence\n\nAfter signing in with a wallet, refreshing the tab logged the user out because cookies and server-side auth weren\u2019t configured correctly on first attempt.\n\nFix:\nI moved session handling to Supabase Auth + JWT with SIWE signature validation. This made login persistence stable across reloads and different browsers.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time pressure during build\n\nIntegrating AI + on-chain + PDF + database can easily spiral into scope creep. The risk was building too much and not finishing.\n\nFix:\nI locked the absolute core flow first:\n\u2192 TX hash \u2192 autofill \u2192 AI \u2192 PDF \u2192 dashboard\n\nOnly after that worked end-to-end, I added verification and warranty metadata.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nTraditional online games and auction platforms often lack transparency, true ownership, and strategic personalization. Users can\u2019t verify fairness, and assets are usually stored in centralized systems with no real value outside the game.\n\nBID-ION solves this by combining:\n\nAI for smarter, adaptive gameplay,\n\nBlockchain (Monad) for transparency, decentralization, and real NFT ownership,\n\nAnd real-time auctions with strategic card battles that reward skill and decision-making.\n\nIt transforms static, luck-based games into intelligent, trustless ecosystems where users truly own and control their digital assets.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges We Ran Into\nWhile building MonadAuction, we encountered several challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and technical knowledge:\n\nSmart Contract Integration: One of the biggest hurdles was ensuring smooth integration between the frontend and the deployed smart contracts on the Monad blockchain. Handling transactions securely and making sure the contract execution was error-free on the testnet required careful attention to gas optimization and transaction validation.\n\nHow We Overcame It: We utilized Ether.js to manage the connection between the smart contract and the frontend. By leveraging Ether.js' functionality to estimate gas and handle transactions securely, we were able to ensure that every interaction with the smart contract was seamless. Extensive testing on the testnet allowed us to debug issues and optimize for efficiency.\n\nAI Bidding Agents: Implementing AI-driven bidding agents that could place bids autonomously in real-time posed both technical and strategic challenges. We had to ensure the agents were making intelligent, competitive bids while adhering to predefined strategies without interfering with user bids.\n\nHow We Overcame It: We designed a basic machine learning model to simulate competitive bidding strategies, adjusting parameters like bid amounts and timings. After fine-tuning the model, we integrated it into the bidding process to ensure it interacted seamlessly with the auction mechanics.\n\nReal-Time Auction Updates: Ensuring real-time updates of auction statuses and bid placements for a large number of users proved difficult due to latency and synchronization issues between the frontend and backend.\n\nHow We Overcame It: We employed WebSockets to implement real-time data streaming, ensuring that updates to bids, auction timers, and notifications were instant and synchronized across all users, providing a smooth user experience.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n\ud83d\udd27 The Problem It Solves:\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 1. Smart Contracts Lack Contextual Intelligence\nTraditional smart contracts are rigid and rule-based. They require all conditions to be predefined and static. For example, a contract might say, \u201cIf ETH > $3,000, then sell\u201d, but it lacks understanding of the broader market context\u2014like volatility, volume shifts, or upcoming economic events. This leads to poor decision-making, missed opportunities, or unnecessary transactions.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 2. Oracles Provide Raw Data, Not Decisions\nBlockchain applications often rely on oracles (like Chainlink) to bring off-chain data on-chain. While these oracles provide price feeds, news, or weather data, they don\u2019t interpret or act on the data. The burden of logic still falls on the developer, and that logic is often hardcoded and limited.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 3. No Seamless Integration Between AI & Blockchain\nWhile AI and blockchain are powerful individually, few platforms seamlessly combine them. Most AI applications operate off-chain, while smart contracts stay on-chain, with little to no meaningful interaction. There's a missing bridge that allows real-time AI decisions to directly trigger onchain actions securely and autonomously.\n\n\u2705 How CognitoSign Solves This\n\u2705 1. AI-Enhanced Smart Contract Agents\nCognitoSign introduces AI-powered autonomous agents that can analyze real-world data through Google\u2019s Gemini AI, make intelligent decisions, and then trigger smart contract actions on the Base blockchain. This enables smart contracts that are context-aware, adaptive, and dynamic.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIf ETH shows signs of true market volatility (not just a spike), an agent may purchase insurance automatically.\n\nIf a verified disaster event is detected, it can automatically donate crypto to relief efforts.\n\n\u2705 2. Custom Triggers & Real-World Relevance\nUsers can define custom conditions and actions, but instead of just relying on binary thresholds, CognitoSign uses AI to interpret inputs:\n\nIs the event confirmed?\n\nIs the market truly unstable?\n\nIs there enough confidence to act?\n\nThis solves the problem of over-simplified logic in smart contracts.\n\n\u2705 3. Transparent, Trustworthy Execution\nAll AI decisions are:\n\nAuditable (you can view the reasoning)\n\nOnchain recorded (actions are verified and immutable)\n\nDashboard-accessible (track every agent, every decision)\n\nThis bridges the AI \u2192 Decision \u2192 Blockchain Execution pipeline\u2014solving the problem of disconnected systems.\n\n\u2705 4. Base Blockchain for Scalability\nBy building on Base (Ethereum L2), CognitoSign ensures that intelligent agents operate cost-effectively, quickly, and securely, making the solution viable for real-world adoption not just as a demo or concept.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 In Summary\nCognitoSign solves the pressing problem of dumb, inflexible smart contracts by transforming them into autonomous, AI-powered agents. It merges the interpretive power of AI with the execution guarantees of blockchain, creating a new category of decentralized applications that are intelligent, reactive, and practical.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Challenges I Ran Into:\n\n1. Bridging AI and Onchain Logic\nChallenge: One of the most significant hurdles was integrating Gemini AI with smart contract logic in a way that allowed real-time, context-aware decisions to be translated into onchain actions. AI models output natural language or structured JSON, but smart contracts need deterministic, binary triggers.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe created a clear mapping layer where Gemini\u2019s JSON analysis results (like volatility level or event verification status) were parsed into actionable smart contract conditions. We also built fallback rules to ensure determinism when AI output was ambiguous.\n\n2. OnchainKit & Base Blockchain Deployment\nChallenge: Deploying smart contracts on the Base Testnet (and preparing for Base Mainnet) required configuring the correct wallet connection, gas management, and contract compilation flow\u2014especially while using OnchainKit for abstraction.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe isolated and modularized all blockchain-related logic using utilities (wallet-connect.tsx, web3.ts, smartContract.ts). We rigorously tested deployments on Base Testnet using MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. We also added support for gas fee limits and network validation to avoid failed deployments.\n\n3. AI Input Validation and Error Handling\nChallenge: Since users provide custom JSON inputs for AI analysis, malformed data could easily break the flow or return poor-quality decisions.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe implemented strict input validation and error-handling checks in the frontend. We also gave users sample JSONs and helpful tooltips to reduce formatting errors. On the backend, the Gemini integration was wrapped with safe fallback responses to handle API errors gracefully.\n\n4. Storing and Monitoring Agent States\nChallenge: Tracking the lifecycle of agents (created \u2192 deployed \u2192 pending \u2192 active) along with their associated contracts and execution logs required a reliable and real-time backend storage model.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe used PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM to maintain clean and normalized records of agents and executions. A real-time dashboard was built to fetch agent status and logs using server-side APIs, ensuring users could always monitor what's happening.\n\n5. Building a Usable yet Technical UI\nChallenge: Designing a frontend that feels approachable to non-technical users but also supports advanced agent configuration (like custom conditions, contract settings, etc.) was tricky.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe used shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS to build a clean, responsive interface. Components like the agent form, dashboard cards, and AI integration page were broken into logical steps with tooltips, defaults, and error messages to make the process intuitive.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# The Problems Milestone Solves  \n\nMilestone tackles systemic failures in civic infrastructure management that plague governments and citizens alike. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the critical pain points:  \n\n---\n\n### **Bureaucratic Black Holes**  \n**Problem**:  Reports vanish into endless emails, spreadsheets, or unmonitored hotlines. Manual triage delays responses for weeks (or months), eroding public trust.  \n\n**Example**:  A citizen reports a pothole, but the request gets buried under paperwork. No one knows who\u2019s responsible, and repairs never happen.  \n\n---\n\n### **Zero Accountability**  \n**Problem**:  No transparency in task assignment, budgeting, or progress tracking. Contractors face no penalties for missed deadlines or subpar work.  \n\n**Example**:  A worker takes payment upfront but delays repairs indefinitely. The city lacks tools to enforce consequences.  \n\n---\n\n### **Privacy Risks**  \n**Problem**:  Citizens fear reporting issues due to exposed personal data (e.g., names, addresses). Governments struggle to verify identities without invasive methods.  \n\n**Example**:  A resident avoids reporting a broken streetlight to avoid spam or retaliation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Slow, Opaque Payments**  \n**Problem**:  Workers wait months for payments due to manual invoicing and approvals. Citizens have no visibility into how tax dollars are spent.  \n\n**Example**:  A contractor fixes a bridge but can\u2019t pay bills while waiting for a check.  \n\n---\n\n### **Crypto Complexity**  \n**Problem**:  Workers and citizens avoid blockchain solutions due to gas fees, wallets, and technical jargon. Governments can\u2019t adopt crypto tools without simplified UX.  \n\n---\n## **1. Citizen Reports an Issue**  \n- **Login**: Citizen authenticates via **Self.xyz\u2019s ZK-proofs**, proving residency without exposing personal data.  \n- **Report**: Types a natural language description (e.g., *\u201cBroken streetlight at Oak Park entrance\u201d*).  \n1. **Self.xyz SDK** generates a zero-knowledge proof to verify the citizen\u2019s residency.  \n2. **AgentKit\u2019s LLM agent** parses the grievance by analysing the image for situation Aware  \n   - Extracts GPS coordinates, issue type (e.g., \"streetlight\"), and severity.  \n   - Auto-generates a task budget and timeline.  \n3. A **smart contract** (deployed on **Base Network**) is created, storing task details onchain.  \n---\n## **2. Task Assignment & Bidding**  \n- **Workers** (contractors) view open tasks in their area and submit bids.  \n1. Task details (budget, deadline, location) are published to a public bidding dashboard.  \n2. **Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs)** enforce rules:  \n   - Penalty clauses (e.g., *\u201cMiss deadline \u2192 lose $20/day\u201d*) are embedded in the contract.  \n   - Bids and worker reputations are stored onchain.  \n---\n## **3. Work Execution & Verification**  \n- **Worker** accepts the task, completes repairs, and submits proof (e.g., photos, IoT sensor data).  \n1. **RSC** pulls cross-chain data (e.g., Base \u2192 React) to update the DAO dashboard and Payments.  \n2. **RSCs** trigger milestone payments via **Sablier streaming** on Base Network on hold and pay basis - funds are realsed only after completion\n---\n## **4. Payment & Transparency**  \n- **Citizen** receives a *\u201cFixed!\u201d* notification with onchain proof.  \n- **Worker** claims payment in ETH via Reactive Network.  \n1. **Base Network** processes instant payments, recorded onchain.  \n2. Funds stream to the worker\u2019s Smart Wallet; penalties (if any) auto-revert to the DAO. \n---\n## **5. DAO Governance** \n- **Citizens** vote on disputes, budget changes, or protocol upgrades.\n1. **RSCs** auto-execute approved decisions.\n---\n# Key Differentiators & Uniqueness\n\n---\n\n## **Core Innovations**\n### 1. **AI-Driven Civic Problem-Solving**\n   - **Predictive Analytics**: Proactively flags issues (e.g., potholes, floods) using IoT sensor data + historical patterns, **before** citizens report them.\n   - **Auto-Verification**: AI (AgentKit) validates work completion via image recognition (e.g., confirming a repaired road), reducing human bias.\n\n### 2. **Reactive Penalty System**\n   - Funds are **automatically redistributed to the community** if workers miss deadlines, enforced by Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs). No existing civic platform penalizes delays trustlessly.\n\n### 3. **Hybrid Voting Mechanism**\n   - Combines **quadratic voting** (community sentiment) with **AI scoring** (objective metrics like repair durability) for fair, balanced assessments.\n\n### 4. **Privacy-Preserving Participation**\n   - Self Protocol\u2019s ZKPs let users prove residency/eligibility **without exposing personal data**\u2014unlike centralized platforms that collect IDs.\n\n### 5. **Cross-Chain DAO Funding**\n   - Accepts donations/payments across chains (ETH, MATIC, BTC) via ZetaChain, enabling global participation in local governance.\n\n---\n## **Improvements Over Similar Projects**\n1. **vs. FixMyStreet (Gov\u2019t Portals)**:\n   - **Transparency**: All workflows (funding, worker assignments) are on-chain.\n   - **Speed**: AI auto-pro\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**AI Misclassification of Civic Issues**\nProblem: The AI layer sometimes misclassified image inputs (e.g., confusing a pothole for a shadow), which led to incorrect task categorization.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n## The Safety Crisis in Autonomous AI Agents\n\nAs AI agents gain autonomy over cryptocurrency transactions, they face a critical safety problem: **how do you prevent an AI agent from draining wallets or sending funds to malicious addresses?**\n\nCurrent solutions force developers to choose between:\n- **Full Trust**: Give the agent complete control and hope nothing goes wrong\n- **Manual Approval**: Require human approval for every transaction, defeating the purpose of autonomy\n\n## How AgentGuard Solves This\n\nAgentGuard provides **on-chain policy enforcement** that protects autonomous agents without sacrificing their autonomy. It acts as a safety layer between AI agents and blockchain transactions.\n\n### Key Features:\n\n**\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f SmartWallet Architecture**\n- All agent funds are held in a smart contract wallet, not a basic EOA\n- Every transaction goes through the Sheriff policy engine before execution\n- Transactions that violate policies are blocked on-chain, not just logged\n\n**\ud83d\udccb Flexible Policy Engine**\n- **Spending Limits**: Set maximum amounts per token (e.g., max 10 USDC per transaction)\n- **Address Controls**: Denylist sanctioned addresses, or use allowlist for approved recipients only\n- **Function Restrictions**: Control which smart contract functions the agent can call\n- **ETH Value Limits**: Cap the amount of ETH sent per transaction\n\n**\ud83d\udd27 Developer-Friendly CLI**\n- `npx agent-guard init` - Generate policy configuration files\n- `npx agent-guard run` - Deploy contracts on local Base fork and start monitoring\n- `npx agent-guard test` - Validate policies against test scenarios\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Real-World Demo**\nThe project includes a working demo with Aerodrome Finance (Base's leading DEX) showing:\n- \u2705 Allowed: Swap 10 USDC for AERO (within limit)\n- \u274c Blocked: Swap 11 USDC for AERO (exceeds limit)\n- \u274c Blocked: Transfer to denylisted address (even if under limit)\n\n### Use Cases:\n\n**DeFi Yield Farmers**: Let your agent optimize yield strategies while ensuring it can't drain more than your risk tolerance\n\n**Trading Bots**: Allow autonomous trading with hard limits on position sizes and approved DEXs only\n\n**Payment Agents**: Enable agents to handle routine payments while restricting recipients to a pre-approved allowlist\n\n**Hackathon Development**: Build and test crypto agents locally without risking real funds or testnet rate limits\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## 1. Contract Deployment & Nonce Management\n\n**Challenge**: Initially faced \"nonce has already been used\" errors when deploying multiple contracts sequentially on Anvil.\n\n**Root Cause**: The ethers.js v6 `JsonRpcProvider` was caching transaction counts, returning stale nonces even after transactions were mined due to Anvil's instant mining.\n\n**Solution**: Disabled provider caching by setting `cacheTimeout: -1` in the provider configuration. Also fixed the HDNodeWallet derivation path to use root `m` instead of default depth 5.\n\n## 2. Architectural Pivot: Off-Chain to On-Chain Enforcement\n\n**Challenge**: Initially built AgentGuard with off-chain policy monitoring (logging-only mode), but this created race conditions where transactions could be executed before policy checks completed.\n\n**Solution**: Made a major architectural change to pure on-chain enforcement:\n- Introduced SmartWallet contract that routes all transactions through Sheriff\n- Sheriff.check() now blocks violating transactions on-chain with revert\n- Removed the off-chain PolicyEngine in favor of trustless on-chain validation\n\nThis was a breaking change but resulted in stronger security guarantees.\n\n## 3. ERC20 Amount Limit Enforcement\n\n**Challenge**: How to enforce per-token spending limits when the Sheriff contract receives arbitrary calldata?\n\n**Solution**: Implemented calldata decoding in Solidity to extract transfer amounts:\n- Decode function selector (first 4 bytes) to identify transfer type\n- For `transfer(address,uint256)`: decode amount from bytes 36-68\n- For `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)`: decode amount from bytes 68-100\n- For `approve(address,uint256)`: decode approved amount\n\nThis allows Sheriff to enforce different limits for different tokens dynamically.\n\n## 4. Policy Decision API Design\n\n**Challenge**: Creating a clear, deterministic API for policy violations that both contracts and off-chain tools can understand.\n\n**Solution**: Implemented structured response system:\n- `PolicyContext` struct with all transaction metadata (wallet, caller, target, value, data, timestamp)\n- `PolicyDecision` struct with boolean allowed flag, uint8 violation code, and bytes32 policyId\n- `PolicyCode` enum with specific codes: OK, AMOUNT_EXCEEDS, DENYLIST, NOT_IN_ALLOWLIST, VALUE_EXCEEDS, INVALID_SELECTOR, UNAUTHORIZED\n- Events emit full context for observability: `PolicyChecked`, `ExecutionEvaluated`, `ExecutionSucceeded`\n\nThis makes debugging and monitoring much easier.\n\n## 5. Aerodrome Integration on Base Fork\n\n**Challenge**: Testing with real DeFi protocols (Aerodrome) required forking Base mainnet, but Aerodrome contracts weren't deployed on testnets.\n\n**Solution**: \n- Built the system to work with Anvil's `--fork-url` for Base mainnet\n- Documented requirement to use `base-mainnet` fork (not testnets)\n- Created demo scenarios that actually swap on Aerodrome pools\n- Pre-funded SmartWallet with test tokens to enable realistic testing\n\n## 6. Developer Experience: CLI Configuration\n\n**Challenge**: Balancing flexibility with simplicity in policy configuration.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Created TypeScript-based config file (`agent-guard.config.ts`) with Zod validation\n- Auto-generate `.agentguard.env` with deployed addresses after `npx agent-guard run`\n- Provide helper functions like `addSafeERC20Selectors()` for common patterns\n- Split library exports from CLI entry point for programmatic usage\n\nThe result is a system that's both powerful and approachable for hackathon developers.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Coin Cast** is designed to tackle two pressing challenges within the Web3 ecosystem: **the sustainability of token projects and the monetisation struggles of content creators**. \n\n**1. Token Projects Lose Momentum**\nMany ERC-20 token projects launched on platforms like Clanker and Zora face a common issue: they lose traction shortly after their initial launch. This happens due to:\n**Lack of Ongoing Promotion:** After the hype of a token launch fades, there\u2019s often no mechanism to maintain visibility or interest.\n\n**Insufficient Community Engagement:** Without active participation from supporters, tokens struggle to build a loyal user base.\n\n**No Rewards for Supporters:** Loyal community members who could drive long-term growth aren\u2019t incentivised to stay engaged.\n\nAs a result, these tokens experience declining liquidity, reduced trading volume, and a drop in value, undermining their potential for success.\n\n**2. Content Creators Lack Incentives**\nMicro-creators on platforms like Zora and Farcaster produce valuable content that could amplify token projects, but they face significant hurdles:\n\n**No Direct Connection to Token Projects:** There\u2019s a disconnect between content creators and the token ecosystems they could promote.\n\n**Limited Monetization Options:** Traditional revenue streams like ads or tips are insufficient or inconsistent for many creators.\n\n**Unrewarded Promotion Efforts:** Creators who advocate for token projects don\u2019t receive tangible rewards tied to those projects\u2019 success.\n\nThis misalignment prevents a natural synergy between token creators and content creators, leaving both groups underserved.\n\n**How Coin Cast Addresses These Needs**\nCoin Cast bridges the gap between token creators and content creators, creating a unified ecosystem where aligned incentives drive sustainable growth. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n**A Unified Ecosystem**\n\n**Linking Tokens and Content:** Coin Cast connects parent tokens (e.g., ERC-20 tokens launched on Clanker) with child tokens (e.g., Zora Coins) and content from platforms like Zora and Farcaster. This integration forms a cohesive network where token projects gain visibility through content, and creators gain access to token-based opportunities.\n\n**Seamless Cross-Platform Experience: **By integrating with leading platforms, Coin Cast eliminates the need for users to navigate disconnected systems, enhancing accessibility and usability.\n\n**Incentivised Promotion Through Fee Sharing**\n\n**Fee-Sharing Mechanism:** Token creators can allocate a portion of their trading fees (e.g., from Uniswap V3 pools) or liquidity pool (LP) fees to content creators. These rewards are distributed based on engagement metrics such as:\nMints: When content drives token minting.\n\nTrades: When promotion increases trading volume.\n\nLikes/Recasts: When content boosts social engagement on platforms like Farcaster.\n\n**Direct Rewards:** Unlike platforms relying on indirect monetisation (e.g., ads), Coin Cast uses a transparent, blockchain-based system to ensure creators are fairly compensated for their contributions.\n\n**Sustainable Growth for Token Projects**\n\n**Community-Driven Momentum:** By rewarding content creators and supporters, Coin Cast fosters a thriving community that keeps token projects active and relevant long after launch.\n\n**Enhanced Liquidity and Value:** Continuous promotion by incentivised creators drives trading activity, preserving token value and liquidity over time.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe biggest challenged we faced was testing without real LP fees\n\nChallenge: The biggest challenge was testing the complete flow without an actual LP fee-generating token. Though we had our split and distribution contracts ready, we couldn't verify if they worked properly in real conditions.\n\nSolution: Deployed custom Clanker contracts, created our own liquidity pool, and manually generated LP fees to simulate the entire process and ensure everything was functioning correctly.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nThe main aim of participating in Based India is to get onchain on the fastest growing L2 and experience the Base ecosystem. Also Indian subcontinent has seen a major growth in the web3 area in the last 2-3 years, so we wanted to be a part of the community to learn and develop. The buildathon had almost zero restrictions on creativity and out of the box thinking, so it motivated us to liberally develop the product. We being the residents of India, understand the problems faced by the people here, so we had the chance to address one problem and provide a perfect solution to it and this buildathon was the most promising one for us. These were the main reasons behind our motivation to build in Based India.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn the current music industry, artists and creators often struggle to secure fair revenue from their work, as intermediaries such as labels, streaming platforms, and distributors take a significant portion of the profits. Meanwhile, fans and supporters who contribute to an artist\u2019s success have limited opportunities to directly invest in and benefit from the music they love. This traditional model lacks transparency, equitable revenue distribution, and engagement between artists and their audience.\n\nKey Challenges:\nLimited Revenue for Artists: Artists often receive a small percentage of the revenue generated by their music due to high platform fees, contracts with labels, and other intermediaries. This impacts their ability to fund future projects, sustain their careers, and maintain creative independence.\n\nLack of Fan Participation and Ownership: Fans are key to an artist\u2019s success, but they have limited ways to directly support their favorite musicians beyond purchasing or streaming music. Even when they contribute to an artist's growth, they do not share in the financial success or have ownership in the creative output.\n\nCentralized Control and Lack of Transparency: The centralized platforms that control music distribution have monopolistic tendencies, limiting artists' control over their work, and fans\u2019 access to more independent or diverse music. These platforms also lack transparency in how revenue is shared among artists, producers, and stakeholders.\n\nInaccessibility of Early-Stage Funding: Emerging artists often struggle to secure funding for their projects, which limits their ability to produce high-quality content, release new music, or embark on tours. Crowdfunding models exist but often fail to incentivize long-term support or financial rewards for contributors.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThe Music Staking Platform aims to address these challenges by introducing a decentralized, blockchain-based solution that enables direct interaction between artists and fans. It leverages music staking as a way for fans to invest in music projects and share in the financial success of the artists they support. \n\nCore Features:\n\n1]Staking for Music Projects:\nFans can stake tokens to support a specific artist or music project, becoming early backers. These tokens then represent their share in the revenue generated through which they can earn on the basis of the songs reach.This allows fans to have a stake in the success of the music they love.\n\n2] Fair Revenue Distribution:\nRevenue generated from streams, sales, or other income sources is distributed directly to artists, stakeholders, and fans who have staked in the project. This is done transparently using smart contracts, ensuring that everyone receives their fair share without delays.\n\n3] Artist Empowerment:\nArtists maintain creative control and ownership of their work. They can fund their projects by raising capital from their fan base through staking, bypassing traditional gatekeepers like record labels and streaming platforms.\nThe platform gives artists direct access to their fans, allowing them to build stronger, more engaged communities.\n\n4] Decentralization and Transparency:\nUsing blockchain technology, the platform offers full transparency into how revenue is generated, distributed, and shared. Smart contracts automatically execute the distribution of funds, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\nBoth artists and fans can track and verify the flow of funds and staking rewards in real time.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe faced the challenge to calculate the revenue generated by the streams through various platforms, so we created our own streaming platform which uses the ipfs to store the song and it can be streamed on the platform. Thus the revenue generated by these streams is then distributed among the token holders. This makes the process more transparent and easy.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are participating in **Based India** because we believe it\u2019s a platform that fosters innovation, collaboration, and real-world blockchain solutions, aligning perfectly with DocMed\u2019s mission to revolutionize healthcare through decentralization. **India** represents a massive, diverse healthcare market where security, efficiency, and access to medical services are critical concerns. By showcasing DocMed at **Based India**, we aim to leverage blockchain technology to address these challenges and bring a scalable, secure healthcare solution to millions.\n\nMoreover, **Based India** provides an incredible opportunity to connect with like-minded innovators, developers, and industry leaders, allowing us to enhance DocMed\u2019s impact by integrating cutting-edge blockchain tools, especially within the vibrant Indian tech ecosystem. Our participation also underscores our commitment to making healthcare more accessible and efficient, not only in India but across the globe, using decentralized technology.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nAt DockMed, we focus on solving critical challenges in healthcare through blockchain technology, addressing issues around data privacy, payment inefficiencies, and trust in healthcare providers. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the key challenges we are focusing on:\n\n### 1. Data Privacy and Security in Medical Records\n**Challenge:** Healthcare records are vulnerable to cyberattacks in centralized systems, leading to breaches of sensitive patient data.\n**Solution:** DockMed decentralizes medical records with blockchain and zkProofs for privacy, making data tamper-proof and inaccessible to unauthorized parties, which reduces breach risks. We also provide gas sponsorship for cost-effective blockchain transactions.\n\n### 2. Payment Fragmentation in Healthcare\n**Challenge:** The healthcare payment system is fragmented, particularly across borders, leading to delays and high transaction costs.\n**Solution:** DockMed facilitates cross-chain payments, enabling patients and doctors to use their preferred cryptocurrencies. This system removes traditional barriers, ensuring seamless, low-cost transactions globally.\n\n### 3. Lack of Trust in Healthcare Providers\n**Challenge:** Patients struggle to verify the credentials of healthcare providers, especially online, which reduces confidence in telemedicine platforms.\n**Solution:** DockMed uses ZKP verification to ensure only authenticated healthcare professionals operate on its platform. Decentralized identity verification confirms that patients and doctors are who they claim to be, fostering trust in the ecosystem.\n\n### 4. Inefficiencies in Prescription Management\n**Challenge:** The traditional prescription process is prone to errors, delays and miscommunication, particularly in cross-border cases.\n**Solution:** It digitizes prescriptions on the blockchain, ensuring they are tamper-proof and easily accessible. Patients can redeem prescriptions directly on the platform, with transaction fees covered.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission, **DocMed**, directly addresses the challenge of **privacy, security, and inefficiency in healthcare** by leveraging blockchain technology to decentralize medical records, enable secure cross-chain payments, and verify healthcare providers. These challenges are prevalent in today's healthcare systems, where patient data is vulnerable to breaches, and payment systems are fragmented and costly.\n\nDocMed solves these issues by:\n\n- **Decentralizing medical records** on the blockchain, ensuring privacy and tamper-proof security.\n- **Facilitating seamless cross-chain payments**, allowing patients and doctors to transact using their preferred blockchain, reducing inefficiencies and costs.\n- **Verifying healthcare providers** through decentralized identity solutions, ensuring trust and authenticity in healthcare services.\n\nBy addressing these core challenges, DocMed streamlines healthcare management, making it safer, more efficient, and more trustworthy for users.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of DocMed, we faced several technical and operational challenges, particularly around **Cross-Chain Compatibility**, **Decentralization and Privacy**, and **Provider Verification**. Here's how we tackled these hurdles:\n\n1. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**:\nA major challenge was enabling seamless payments across different blockchain networks, each with unique protocols. To solve this, we integrated **CCIP MultiHop Router** technology, which bridges these networks and supports multiple blockchains. This allows users to pay in their preferred currency while ensuring smooth, secure transactions for healthcare providers.\n2. **Decentralization and Privacy**:\nEnsuring the privacy and security of medical records while decentralizing data storage was another complex issue. Blockchain offers decentralization, but ensuring patient data privacy within a decentralized environment was a major concern, particularly with sensitive medical information. We addressed this by integrating **zkProofs** and the **Ethereum Account Service (EAS)**, which allowed us to verify and store medical records securely on-chain without exposing sensitive information. This cryptographic solution allowed us to achieve both decentralization and privacy, keeping patient data secure and verifiable without sacrificing confidentiality.\n3. **Verified Providers**:\nTrust is essential in healthcare, and we wanted to ensure that only authenticated healthcare professionals could join our platform. Verifying providers across different regions with varying credentialing systems was challenging. We implemented ZKP to ensure the authenticity of every doctor and healthcare provider on DocMed. This system ensuring that only trusted, qualified professionals are onboarded.",

Every transaction, every swap, and every balance is public. But for many real users and use cases, this creates friction, exposure, and even risk.\n\nWhile Uniswap v4 unlocks modularity and customization via hooks, it doesn\u2019t natively support confidentiality, especially at the swap level and onchain privacy remains an unsolved problem.\n\n***The Solution: Confidential Swaps via Inco Lightning + Uniswap v4***\n\nThis project enables confidential token swaps on Uniswap v4 using Inco Lightning\u2019s composable privacy layer deployed on Base Sepolia. We leverage Uniswap v4 hooks to seamlessly wrap/unwrap tokens into Confidential ERC20s (cERC20s) during the swap process \u2014 achieving privacy without compromising UX or composability.\n\n***Here\u2019s how it's done:***\n\n- BeforeSwap Hook: The confidential token is unwrapped inside the hook, so the pool sees a standard ERC20 \u2014 fully compatible with Uniswap\u2019s core logic.\n\n- AfterSwap Hook: After the trade is executed, the token is rewrapped into its confidential counterpart, shielding the user's final balance.\n\nUsers interact with the same interfaces and tools they already use, while the privacy logic runs behind the scenes. By bringing seamless confidentiality to token swaps, this product makes DeFi safer, more usable, and more appealing for the next wave of users and developers.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nNo major challenges except setting up the pool with the right wrap/unwrap permissions.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nIn India, the challenge of securely verifying institutional data, especially for students, has long been a concern. By leveraging blockchain technology through Credichain, we can address this issue efficiently. Credichain provides a transparent, tamper-proof system for verifying academic and professional credentials.Using SoulBoundNFTs, creating non-transferable NFTs as credentials for students. This ensures that institutions and employers can trust the authenticity of student records. Both the student and institution needs to be verified with World id. Moreover, by integrating Credichain, students can also benefit from discounts and rewards linked to verified credentials, promoting both trust and incentivization. We are participating in Based India to solve this fundamental problem, ensuring data integrity and verification while empowering students with financial benefits. Blockchain offers an innovative way to eliminate fraud, streamline processes, and build trust within educational and professional ecosystems. With Credichain, we aim to create a seamless, secure, and accessible system that transforms how India manages and verifies institutional data, while directly impacting students' lives in meaningful ways.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are focusing on the challenge of secure and reliable verification of institutional data, particularly for students in India. Traditionally, verifying credentials has been a cumbersome, time-consuming process prone to errors and fraud. This not only impacts students but also educational institutions and employers, who rely on accurate data to make informed decisions.\n\nAlso, students have the ability to get student-only perks such as discounts on gadgets, study material, etc. \n\nWith the help of BASE and leveraging tools like OnchainKit for smart wallets, we aim to solve this problem by creating an immutable, decentralized system for verifying student credentials on-chain. This will provide institutions, employers, and students with a secure and transparent way to authenticate records. Additionally, by integrating smart wallets, students can receive benefits like discounts, scholarships, and rewards based on their verified credentials, promoting trust while empowering them financially.\n\nThrough this project, we address both the inefficiencies in credential verification and the lack of secure financial incentives for students, bringing real-world impact to our community.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission tackles the challenge of secure institutional data verification and financial empowerment for students through a comprehensive solution that combines **World ID**, **Soulbound NFTs**, and **OnchainKit** smart wallets. \n\nBy integrating **World ID** for decentralized identity verification, we ensure that users are authenticated in a privacy-preserving and decentralized manner, providing a robust layer of trust. Both the student and institution needs to be verified with World Id to transact credentials. \n\nThe **Soulbound NFTs** represent non-transferable credentials, such as academic degrees or certificates, that are permanently linked to the student\u2019s identity. These NFTs are stored in **OnchainKit** smart wallets, giving students full control over their verified credentials and enabling them to share their data with institutions, employers, or other entities without the risk of tampering. This not only solves the issue of credential fraud but also streamlines the verification process, eliminating the need for lengthy bureaucratic procedures.\n\nThe project further enhances the student experience by leveraging the smart wallet\u2019s capabilities. Students can receive discounts, scholarships, and financial aid based on their verified credentials, with seamless access to these benefits directly from their wallet. The combination of **World ID**, **Soulbound NFTs**, and **OnchainKit** creates a secure, transparent, and incentivized ecosystem for students, educational institutions, and employers.\n\nThis project has the potential to revolutionize how institutional data is managed and verified in India, significantly reducing fraud, improving efficiency, and empowering students with tangible financial benefits tied to their academic achievements. The decentralized approach ensures that data is secure, trustworthy, and accessible to all stakeholders, fostering greater trust and collaboration within the education and employment sectors.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### Challenges We Ran Into\n\n1. **Lack of a Frontend Developer**  \n   Both of us are primarily smart contract developers, and one of the major challenges we faced was the absence of a dedicated frontend developer. This meant that we had to step out of our comfort zone and handle the UI/UX components ourselves. Despite being backend-focused, we collaborated and learned the necessary skills to build a functional frontend, though it slowed down the process. \n\n2. **Configuring World ID**  \n   Setting up and integrating **World ID** into our project posed a significant challenge. Configuring the app ID and ensuring the decentralized identity authentication worked seamlessly with our system required deep dives into documentation and troubleshooting. We spent considerable time testing and debugging, but in the end, we successfully integrated World ID to enhance user verification in a privacy-preserving manner.\n\n3. **Fuzz Testing Contracts**  \n   Another hurdle was thoroughly testing our smart contracts to ensure they could handle edge cases and potential breakdowns. We used fuzz testing to simulate various scenarios, pushing our contracts to their limits to ensure security and reliability. Identifying and resolving unexpected contract behavior was time-consuming but crucial in delivering a robust solution. \n\nThese challenges helped us grow as developers and allowed us to deliver a secure, decentralized credential verification system despite the obstacles.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nOur project was started when the hackathon started.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nParticipants in the Based India hackathon often engage for various compelling reasons. One primary motivation is the opportunity to innovate. Hackathons, in general,provide a unique platform for individuals to brainstorm and develop solutions to real-world problems, encouraging the exploration of new ideas and technologies in a collaborative environment.\nNetworking is another significant aspect of participating in hackathons. These events allow individuals to connect with like-minded peers, mentors, and industry professionals. Building these connections can lead to future collaborations, job opportunities, and valuable relationships within the tech and social impact communities.\nSkill development is also a key benefit. Hackathons often involve hands-on experience with coding, design, project management, and teamwork. Participants can learn new skills or enhance existing ones in a fast-paced, dynamic setting that encourages growth and experimentation.\nFinally, hackathons are not only challenging but also fun. They offer an exhilarating experience where participants can push their limits while working on exciting and impactful projects. Overall, participating in the Based India hackathon presents a unique blend of innovation, collaboration, and personal growth, those are the reasons we decided to participate.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nDecentralized Exchanges often struggle with significant market impact when they're faced with large-scale orders that exceed their existing liquidity. This prompts whales and institutional investors to migrate their assets to Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) when they're contemplating large-scale trades however in turn taking risk of \"Whale alerts\". Traditional DEXs also face slippage and front-running attacks. There is a need for a DEX which can help institutional investors to enagage in large scale trades without much market impact.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nVeil-Trade, is designed to proficiently manage large orders, thereby complementing the current range of DEXs. Inspired by \"dark pool\" in traditional financial markets, Veil-Trade operates a private double auction which aids institutional investors in large-scale trading. The auction process in Veil-Trade is bifurcated into two phases.\nThe first is the open auction phase, where traders submit the ZK proof of their balance along with their encrypted orders. During this stage, orders are accumulated but not processed. Once the auction concludes, the secret sharing Multiparty Computation (MPC) servers anonymously compare the orders to ascertain a single settlement price. This ensures all corresponding orders are settled instantly at this unified price, with zero spread. Veil-Trade delivers several notable advantages to the ecosystem. It serves as a dark pool for institutional investors, similar to traditional markets, thereby drawing in large scale orders previously handled exclusively by CEXs. Furthermore, token pairs with lower liquidity pools can leverage Veil-Trade to minimize their slippage. Moreover, Veil-Trade effectively neutralizes the advantage of any front-runners prevalent in current DEXs, as they can't extract any pre-trade information from public transactions. \n\nIn this manner, Veil-Trade minimizes slippage, prevents front-running, and is ideal for low liquidity pools and institutional investors\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring our hackathon, we encountered several challenges that tested our team's adaptability and problem-solving skills:\n\nwe accidentally left one of our smart contracts incomplete. Fortunately, we identified this issue early in the development process, which allowed us to address it before final submission. This experience highlighted the importance of thorough review and testing of our contracts to ensure all functionalities were implemented correctly.\n\n We initially used a lower version of the wagmi library, which led to compatibility issues with other components of our project. Given the limited time we had, we decided to stick with this lower version rather than undertake a potentially lengthy migration process. This decision allowed us to focus on completing our core functionalities without getting bogged down by the complexities of upgrading.\nIntegrating a smart wallet posed a significant challenge, primarily due to the required migration from wagmi v1 to v2. This transition demanded a considerable amount of time and effort. To circumvent this hurdle, we opted to integrate the Coinbase wallet instead, which provided a more straightforward solution and allowed us to maintain our development momentum.\n\nOverall, these experiences underscored the importance of adaptability in the face of challenges. By identifying issues promptly and making strategic decisions, we were able to navigate our way through the hackathon successfully.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**[ReTix](https://retix.vercel.app/)** solves the problem of fraud and lack of trust in secondary ticket reselling.\n\nIn traditional ticket marketplaces:\n\t\u2022\tAnyone can list a ticket, even if they don\u2019t actually own it \u2014 leading to fake or duplicate listings.\n\t\u2022\tBuyers have no cryptographic guarantee that the seller will deliver the ticket after payment.\n\t\u2022\tPayments and delivery are not trustless \u2014 they rely on centralized platforms or reputation systems.\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s no proof of delivery \u2014 sellers can claim they sent the ticket, but there\u2019s no verifiable evidence.\n\n**ReTix** addresses all of these issues by introducing cryptographic verification into the resale process:\n\t\u2022\tSellers must prove ticket ownership using Reclaim before they can list.\n\t\u2022\tBuyers\u2019 funds are held in a smart contract escrow \u2014 not controlled by any third party.\n\t\u2022\tAfter sending the ticket via email, sellers submit a zkTLS proof (via Reclaim) that cryptographically confirms the ticket was sent to the buyer\u2019s email address.\n\t\u2022\tOnly after this proof is verified on-chain are funds released to the seller.\n\nIn short, ReTix removes the need for trust, prevents fake listings, and makes delivery verifiable \u2014 all without intermediaries.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building ReTix, we encountered several key technical challenges:\n\t1.\t**Gmail Doesn\u2019t Support zkTLS**\nGmail doesn\u2019t expose the TLS handshake data required for generating native zkTLS proofs. To overcome this, we built a custom application called [email-verifier](https://github.com/abhishek-mvs/email-verifier) that uses Google OAuth 2.0 to access the seller\u2019s Gmail account (with consent). It reads the first email sent to the buyer and extracts the email content, recipient address, and timestamp.\nWe use this data to construct a zkTLS proof. Then, we created a custom Reclaim provider (Id: **1def9b5a-dcb1-403a-bcb8-3f0360fa97fb**) around this mechanism, allowing sellers to cryptographically prove that the email (containing the ticket) was sent \u2014 without relying on any centralized service.\n\t2.\t**Verifying the Correct Ticket Was Sent**\nIt\u2019s not enough to prove that an email was sent \u2014 we also needed to verify that the correct ticket was delivered.\nWhen a seller lists a ticket, we extract the bookingId and transactionId from the BookMyShow URL and use them to generate an encrypted hash. This hash is stored as part of the ticket\u2019s metadata on-chain. To enable this, we created a custom Reclaim provider (Id: **c35f3209-0062-4dec-a173-955ba8e8f45d**) that interacts with BookMyShow and verifies the seller\u2019s ticket ownership at the time of listing.\nLater, when the seller emails the ticket to the buyer and submits a zkTLS proof (via email-verifier), we parse the email content to extract the URL again, derive the bookingId and transactionId, re-compute the encrypted hash, and compare it with the stored metadata.\nIf the hashes match, we confirm that the correct ticket was sent \u2014 ensuring a fully verifiable, trustless transfer.\n\t3.\t**Escrow Lock Edge Cases**\nIf the seller never sends the ticket or doesn\u2019t complete the proof, the buyer\u2019s funds could remain locked in escrow. We implemented a cron-based timeout mechanism that automatically refunds buyers if the delivery isn\u2019t confirmed within a specific time window.\n\n**Improvements Still Needed**\n\t\u2022\tMulti-Platform Support\nRight now, ReTix only supports BookMyShow tickets. We created a custom Reclaim provider specifically for verifying BookMyShow ownership during ticket listing. To scale, we need to build and integrate additional providers for other platforms like District, Paytm Insider, Ticketmaster, etc.\n\t\u2022\tPreventing Duplicate Ticket Delivery\nSellers could potentially email the same ticket to multiple buyers. One possible solution is to hold funds in escrow until after the event, allowing buyers to dispute invalid tickets. However, verifying whether a buyer was denied entry is still an open problem.\n\t\u2022\tNative Ticket Transfers\nBookMyShow supports official ticket transfers for some events \u2014 generating a fresh QR code for the new user. Where available, we plan to integrate this feature to make ticket delivery fully trustless. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not universally supported across events.\n\t\u2022\tOffline/Physical Ticket Support\nWe don\u2019t yet support offline tickets such as wristbands or printed passes. We\u2019re exploring how to add verifiable delivery via postal or courier services, or NFC tap-based proofs in person.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nParticipating in Based India provides a unique opportunity to collaborate with like-minded innovators and tech enthusiasts. It\u2019s a chance to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with blockchain technology while solving real-world problems, like ensuring secure and transparent voting processes. Being part of this community allows us to exchange ideas, gain new perspectives, and contribute to building a tech-driven future for India. It\u2019s not just about showcasing our skills but also learning, growing, and making an impact together.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n1. Ensuring Voter Anonymity: One of the primary challenges is maintaining the anonymity of voters while ensuring that each vote is valid. The system needs to prevent anyone from tracing a vote back to a specific user, while still verifying that each user can vote only once.\n\n2. Preventing Double Voting: Ensuring that users can vote only once is critical in a blockchain-based voting system. Addressing this challenge requires a robust mechanism in the smart contract that prevents any user from casting more than one vote.\n\n3. Smart Contract Security: Since smart contracts handle sensitive data and execute voting logic, ensuring they are secure against vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks and unauthorized access is crucial. This involves thorough testing and security audits.\n\n4. Scalability: As the number of voters increases, the application must handle the load without a significant increase in transaction costs or processing time. Optimizing the gas fees and ensuring that the system can scale to accommodate a large number of users is a challenge.\n\n5. User Experience with Blockchain Interaction: Blockchain technology can be complex for users who are not familiar with it. Simplifying the voting process, such as using MetaMask for easy authentication and making the user interface intuitive, is essential for better user adoption.\n\n6. Transparency vs. Privacy: Balancing transparency (publicly available voting results) with privacy (keeping individual votes secret) is a challenge. Designing a system that allows users to verify the results without compromising privacy is a key focus.\n\n7. Integration with Ethereum Network: Deploying and testing smart contracts on Ethereum test networks like Ropsten or Rinkeby requires ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend (React.js) and the backend (smart contracts). Handling issues like network delays and transaction confirmation times can be challenging.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nEnsuring Voter Anonymity:\nThe smart contract allows each registered voter to cast their vote without recording their identity. It uses only a unique identifier (such as the user's Ethereum address) to verify the voting right, ensuring that the vote remains anonymous.\nOnce the vote is cast, the system does not link it to the user\u2019s Ethereum address, ensuring the anonymity of the voter.\nPreventing Double Voting:\n\nThe smart contract includes logic to check if a voter has already voted before allowing them to cast a new vote. This ensures that each registered address can only cast one vote, preventing double voting.\nVoters are registered and tracked through mappings in the smart contract, ensuring a single vote per registered user.\nSmart Contract Security:\n\nThe smart contract is written in Solidity with best practices for security, including modifiers like onlyOwner for restricted actions and checks to prevent overflows and unauthorized actions.\nThe project includes thorough testing of the smart contract using frameworks like Mocha and Chai to ensure the integrity and security of voting functions.\nA local blockchain environment using Ganache is used to test and validate the contract before deploying to test networks, helping to identify and resolve vulnerabilities early in development.\nScalability:\n\nThe project uses Web3.js and MetaMask to interact with the Ethereum network efficiently, ensuring smooth transactions even as the user base grows.\nThe smart contract is designed to minimize gas costs by optimizing the storage and retrieval of votes, making it more cost-effective for users to participate.\nDeploying to Ethereum test networks (e.g., Ropsten or Rinkeby) allows for scaling testing, ensuring the solution can handle real-world voting scenarios.\nUser Experience with Blockchain Interaction:\n\nThese and many other aspects...\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart Contract Bugs and Testing:\nWriting the voting smart contract in Solidity required careful attention to logic and edge cases, such as checking for double voting and properly incrementing vote counts.\nGas Costs and Optimization:\nA major challenge was optimizing the smart contract to minimize gas fees, which is critical for reducing the cost of transactions. Every additional storage or computation in the contract increases gas costs, so optimizing the contract while maintaining functionality was difficult.\nIntegrating Web3.js with React:\nIntegrating Web3.js with React presented challenges in managing asynchronous calls to the blockchain, such as fetching account information, handling user transactions, and updating the UI based on blockchain events.\nMetaMask User Interaction:\nEnsuring that users understood how to interact with MetaMask for account authentication and transaction approval was another challenge. Many users unfamiliar with blockchain may find this process confusing.\nDeployment to Test Networks:\nDeploying the smart contract to Ethereum test networks like Ropsten or Rinkeby introduced new challenges, such as dealing with network congestion and varying block times.\nBalancing Security with Functionality:\nEnsuring the voting system\u2019s security while maintaining a smooth user experience was difficult. For example, allowing anonymous voting while ensuring that each vote is valid and secure required additional considerations.\nUser Experience Design:\nDesigning an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the complexity of blockchain interactions was a challenge. It involved multiple iterations to ensure that the voting process was clear, and users could easily register, vote, and view results.\nLearning Curve:\nWorking with a combination of technologies, including Solidity, Web3.js, and React.js, required a steep learning curve. Understanding the nuances of blockchain development and integrating different tools effectively took time, especially when\n\n## Additional Features\n\nRole-based Access Control:\nIntroduce roles like Administrator and Voter within the smart contract.\nAdministrators could manage election settings, such as registering candidates, starting and ending voting periods, and viewing detailed analytics.\nEncryption for Added Privacy:\nImplement end-to-end encryption for votes before they are submitted to the blockchain.\nThis would add another layer of privacy, ensuring that even if data on the blockchain is accessed, the vote contents remain encrypted and unreadable.\nReal-Time Results Dashboard:\nCreate a live results dashboard that shows real-time updates as votes are cast and counted.\nUse React and Web3.js to fetch vote counts dynamically from the blockchain and present a graphical view of ongoing election results.\nMulti-Election Support:\nAllow the system to support multiple elections simultaneously by using different instances of the smart contract or using a more complex data structure within a single contract.\nUsers could participate in different elections, with each election having its own set of candidates and results.\nUser-Friendly Registration Process:\nIntegrate social authentication (e.g., using OAuth providers) or DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for easier user registration while maintaining privacy.\nCreate an onboarding guide or tutorial in the application to walk new users through setting up their wallets and connecting to the voting platform.\nTime-Locked Voting\nAdd a time-lock mechanism to control when users can vote. For example, start the voting phase at a specific time and automatically close it after a set duration\nVoting Verification Mechanism\nAllow voters to verify that their vote was counted without revealing the content of their vote. This could be achieved through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) or Merkle proofs.\nDelegated Voting (Proxy Voting)\nEnable a feature for delegated voting, where a user can transfer their voting right to another trusted user if they are unable to vote.\nThese and many other aspects."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI\u2019m participating in Based India to contribute to the development of decentralized solutions for social and community-driven challenges. As India is rapidly adopting digital transformation, I believe that decentralized crowdfunding can play a key role in supporting causes and ventures without relying on traditional financial intermediaries. This project aims to foster transparency, security, and trust, which are crucial in supporting grassroots initiatives and innovations in the region.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the major challenges I am addressing is the lack of transparency and accountability in traditional crowdfunding systems. Contributors often face risks of misuse of funds or lack of updates regarding campaign progress. Additionally, these platforms charge high fees, reducing the overall funds received by campaign creators. This project aims to provide a solution by decentralizing the entire process, ensuring full transparency, reduced costs, and tamper-proof record-keeping.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThe Decentralized Crowdfunding DApp leverages the Base blockchain to allow users to create and manage fundraising campaigns with full transparency. Every contribution and transaction is recorded immutably on the blockchain, providing accountability to all participants. Smart contracts automatically handle fund withdrawals or refunds, ensuring that funds are only accessible to the campaign creator when the fundraising goal is reached. This approach eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces costs, and builds trust among contributors, allowing them to confidently support causes.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the primary challenges was integrating the smart contract with the frontend in a way that was both secure and user-friendly. Handling MetaMask interactions for users who may be unfamiliar with Web3 required detailed error handling and a simplified UI. Additionally, ensuring gas efficiency while maintaining robust contract functionality was another challenge. I overcame this by optimizing the contract code, reducing unnecessary state updates, and ensuring that campaign logic was straightforward yet secure.\n\nAnother challenge was adapting the interface to make it intuitive for users who may not be familiar with blockchain technology. This required multiple iterations on the frontend, improving UX to make actions like contributing and withdrawing funds clear and seamless.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe project was built during the Buildathon from scratch. During the Buildathon, I implemented features like real-time campaign progress tracking, automatic refunds for failed campaigns, and MetaMask integration to ensure seamless wallet connection and transaction handling. I also focused on optimizing the smart contract for low gas fees without compromising security."

But there are many ongoing issues in this sector that are weakening its foundation. In the last decade, over 1 lakh farmers in India have taken their own lives. They faced many problems like heavy debt, low prices for their produce, crop failure, limited financial support and assistance.\n\nTo address some of the above issues we built KrishiCoin. It is focusing on these challenges in the agriculture sector.\n\n**1. Middlemen in Agriculture:** Farmers often rely on middlemen to sell their produce or crops, which reduces their profits. KrishiCoin eliminates these middlemen by enabling direct transactions between farmers and companies, thereby maximizing the farmer\u2019s profit and reducing the company\u2019s cost.\n**2. Difficulty in Reaching Markets:** Many farmers struggle to connect with large buyers or companies. KrishiCoin\u2019s peer-to-peer decentralized marketplace directly connects farmers with companies, providing them with better and larger market access.\n**3. Limited Access to Finance:** Many farmers struggle to get funding, financial assistance or support for their needs in case of emergency. We provide a platform for farmers to raise money through crowdfunding, helping them get funds for social and essential causes.\n**4. Lack of Trust and Transparency:** Traditional financial systems often lack transparency, leading to unfair practices. We uses blockchain to ensure secure, transparent, and trustworthy transactions.\n**5. Digital Divide in Rural Areas:** Farmers in rural areas often miss out on technological advancements. KrishiCoin helps bring them onchain and into DeFi world, making it easy for them to sell products and manage funds digitally.\n**6. Lack of Community Engagement:** Rural communities often lack platforms for sharing knowledge and experiences. Our platform addresses this with a Community Writes section, promoting social engagement among farmers in rural areas.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\n**KrishiCoin** is a P2P and DeFi dApp built on **Base blockchain** (Ethereum L2) for farmers and people in rural areas. It offers features such as peer-to-peer marketplace, crowdfunding, covering all the financial aspects for people in rural areas.\nBelow is the technical breakdown of KrishiCoin to solve the above challenges:\n- **Blockchain Architecture**:\n    - Built on **Base Blockchain** (Ethereum L2) for scalability.\n    - Uses **Solidity** for smart contracts, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum ecosystem.\n- **Smart Contracts**:\n    - Crowdfunding and peer-to-peer marketplaces are handled using smart contracts (written in Solidity) deployed on Base Sepolia Testnet.\n    - Using contracts ensures that everything is transparent, secure, and decentralized on our platform.\n- **React Frontend**:\n    - Intuitive design to access everything from the Home Page of the App.\n    - User friendly dashboard for managing orders, purchases, crop listing, donations, and starting fundraisers.\n- **Web3 Integration**:\n    - Uses **Ether.js** for seamless smart contract interaction.\n- **Coinbase Smart Wallet Integration**:\n    - Used **Coinbase Wallet and Smart Wallet** for easy and seamless onboarding.\n- **OnchainKit for User Experience**:\n    - Integrated various user-friendly components such as Identity, Wallet, Token, and Swap to enhance app usability, design, and engagement.\n- **Basename for Integration**:\n    - Integrated the Basenames in our platform for better Onchain identity.\n- **Coinbase Onramp**:\n    - Integrated Onramp to allow users to add funds to their wallet without leaving our app.\n- **Coinbase API**: \n    - Used Coinbase API to fetch realtime USD/ETH exchange rates required during ordering crops and in donating in crowdfunds. \n- **Thirdweb**:\n    - Used Thirdweb to test and deploy solidity contracts on **Base Sepolia Testnet**.\n- **Community Engagement via Blog Section**:\n    - Features a blogging platform for users to engage and share knowledge and experiences.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe faced the following technical difficulties while building this project.\n - We have written two smart contract for this dApp, one for a decentralized marketplace and other for the crowdfunding. Writing gas efficient and scalable smart contract was a challenging task for us, we analyzed every aspect of it and thoroughly tested the contract for safety and security. We ensured that there is not any permanent blockage of funds in the contract. We also analyze any possible loopholes to steal funds from the contract.\n - The other major challenge we faced was finding out the relevant Base Sepolia Testnet faucets that do not require any minimum Ethereum mainnet balance. Finding those faucets consumed lots of our time. Also there were time restrictions for withdrawing the tokens like very few testnet Ether (ETH) can only be withdrawn in 24 hours.\n - We have also faced few issues while integrating Ether.js for the smart contract interaction from our React frontend. Debugging any issues was very difficult. Any minor problems in the contract would require modifying and complete redeployment of the contract with some modification in the MongoDB database schema as per the new requirement.\n**Contract Address (Deployed on BASE Sepolia Testnet)** : \n    - P2P Marketplace : 0x9B49E0C2bdCDD2e0Cc7f5808A0B039F50366DE2A\n    - Crowdfunding : 0x5F7B8Efb3c8B1836E4d991C51d6379407CC8237b\n(Note : For the successful transaction proof on BASE network, you can view the above contracts) \nFor more detail about the Smart Contracts and the other tech used in KrishiCoin, please refer this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PX4WUSSLD937dsPluUF4CoWpr-C7Eh1E560pLNE8ktA/edit?usp=sharing",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are participating to showcase the potential of blockchain technology in empowering individuals, especially content creators, freelancers, and small businesses in India. The rise of digital payments in the region creates a unique opportunity to leverage decentralized solutions for more secure, low-cost, and transparent financial transactions. BaseTip aims to facilitate micro-payments and tipping, which can benefit millions in India's growing digital economy. We are also excited to contribute to the development of a global blockchain community that includes India as a key player in driving adoption and innovation.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe challenge we are addressing is the difficulty of sending and receiving micro-tips online. Current systems for tipping content creators, freelancers, or service providers often involve centralized platforms with high fees, limited user control, and geographic restrictions. We aim to create a seamless, decentralized way to transfer small amounts of cryptocurrency, empowering users with greater financial control and lower transaction costs.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nBaseTip is a simple decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency tips using the Base blockchain. It utilizes a smart contract to facilitate decentralized micro-payments with minimal fees, ensuring that content creators, freelancers, and service providers can receive tips directly from their supporters. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, BaseTip reduces costs and increases the speed of transactions. The project can make a significant impact in communities where traditional financial systems are less accessible or expensive for micro-transactions.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nTechnical Hurdle: One of the main challenges was integrating the smart contract with a simple and user-friendly front-end. Since blockchain technology can be intimidating for users who are new to crypto, we focused on designing a minimalistic interface that makes sending tips as straightforward as possible.\n\nGas Fees Optimization: Ensuring that the smart contract was optimized for low gas fees was another challenge. We used Solidity best practices to minimize unnecessary computations and reduce transaction costs.\n\nLearning Curve: Some of our team members were new to the Base blockchain, so there was a learning curve in understanding the specifics of the network and deployment process. We overcame this by collaborating closely, sharing resources, and conducting research to solve any issues that arose."

Use Merkle trees or other off-chain proofs to reduce on-chain computations for airdrop eligibility.\nEvent Logging: Use events to track staking, unstaking, and airdrop activities, which can be used off-chain for further optimization and monitoring.\nUser Experience:\n\nWeb3 Integration: Use libraries like Ethers.js or Web3.js to provide a simple interface for users to interact with the staking and airdrop functionalities, such as connecting their wallets, approving transactions, and viewing rewards.\nClear Messaging: Provide clear instructions and feedback for every step (e.g., pending transactions, confirmation of staking/airdrop, etc.) to improve the user experience.\nToken Distribution:\n\nFair Reward Calculation: Ensure staking rewards and airdrop allocations are calculated based on predefined parameters (e.g., staked amount and time) to prevent manipulation.\nMerkle Proof for Airdrops: For large-scale airdrops, use Merkle trees to efficiently prove user eligibility off-chain, minimizing the gas costs on-chain.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding a staking dApp with airdropping was a wild ride! From tackling unexpected smart contract bugs and optimizing for gas efficiency, to managing complex reward calculations and ensuring secure, fair airdrop distribution\u2014every step pushed me to innovate. Gas costs soared, edge cases popped up, and user experience had to be seamless, despite network delays. Testing in simulated environments threw curveballs, but in the end, each challenge made the dApp stronger, more secure, and ready to scale. It's been a test of creativity, patience, and deep problem-solving.",

Meanwhile, AI-generated art is often isolated to creation platforms, with little connection to ownership or gamified interaction. Furthermore, traditional NFT games require expensive assets, complex onboarding, or offer limited creative freedom to users.\n\nOur project solves these challenges by:\n\nMerging AI-generated creativity with on-chain ownership: Users can generate unique artwork using AI, then mint it as NFTs\u2014giving real value and identity to their creations.\n\nGamifying the experience: Instead of passively holding NFTs, users can enter their AI-generated NFTs into battles within a digital arena, adding competitive and entertainment value to the ownership experience.\n\nLowering the barrier to entry: Through intuitive AI interfaces and seamless minting, even non-technical users can participate in the world of NFTs and Web3 gaming.\n\nEncouraging creativity and personalization: Unlike preset in-game assets, users define their characters through prompts and imagination, making every NFT unique and meaningful.\n\nCreating utility for AI art: Instead of just showcasing AI art, this project gives it a life, purpose, and a way to interact in a larger ecosystem.\n\nBy combining AI, blockchain, and gaming, our platform bridges the gap between passive ownership and interactive digital experiences\u2014making NFTs more accessible, engaging, and useful.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIntegrating AI image generation with Web3: Connecting an external AI model (like Hugging Face or Stability AI) and formatting its output for minting as an NFT was more complex than expected. Handling file formats, image data conversion, and asynchronous generation required deep coordination between frontend and backend logic.\n\nMinting workflow complexity: Ensuring the minting process remained gas-efficient and user-friendly was challenging. We had to carefully handle wallet connections, image uploads, metadata storage (IPFS or Arweave), and smart contract interactions, all while keeping the UI intuitive.",

At the same time, existing payment models are poorly suited for AI-driven analysis\u2014relying on subscriptions, API keys, or manual payments that break automation.\n>\n> This project solves both problems by introducing an AI agent that analyzes prediction market data and delivers concise, decision-ready insights (Yes/No verdicts, reasoning, and confidence scores), while using the **x402 pay-per-use payment protocol** to enable frictionless, on-demand monetization. Users pay only when value is delivered\u2014whether generating an analysis report or executing a trade\u2014making AI-assisted prediction trading efficient, autonomous, and economically fair.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Challenges I Ran Into\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles was **integrating micropayments into an AI-driven flow without breaking UX or automation**.\n\n## Problem\nWhile implementing the x402 payment flow, I initially tried to treat it like a traditional API key\u2013based or subscription system. This caused multiple issues:\n- Payments were tightly coupled with business logic, making the API hard to reason about.\n- The ML service couldn\u2019t retry requests cleanly after receiving an HTTP 402 Payment Required response.\n- Wallet signatures and payment authorization logic became scattered across the backend, leading to inconsistent failures and poor error handling.\n\nAdditionally, since x402 relies on **stateless, per-request payments**, even small mismatches in payload fields (amount, nonce, asset, network) caused silent verification failures, which were difficult to debug.\n\n## Solution\nI redesigned the system around the **x402 protocol itself**, instead of forcing it into a Web2-style pattern:\n- Treated 402 responses as a **first-class control signal**, not an error.\n- Isolated payment verification into a dedicated middleware layer, keeping ML logic completely payment-agnostic.\n- Implemented a clean retry flow where the client automatically signs the payment and replays the request once the cost is known.\n- Added structured logging for payment metadata (paymentId, nonce, asset, network), which made failures reproducible and debuggable.\n\nThis separation allowed the AI agent to operate autonomously while payments happened transparently in the background.\n\n### Outcome\nBy embracing x402\u2019s design philosophy, the system became:\n- Fully **pay-per-use** with no subscriptions or API keys\n- Easier to debug and extend\n- Naturally compatible with autonomous AI agents and on-chain execution\n\nThis challenge fundamentally changed how I think about payments\u2014not as an add-on, but as a **protocol-level primitive** for agentic systems.",

We built it on the **Base Sepolia testnet**, and it lets you play fun, classic games like **Dice**, **Mines**, and **Plinko** \u2014 all powered by smart contracts.\n\nNo central system, no shady stuff. Every action \u2014 placing bets, deciding outcomes, giving payouts \u2014 runs on-chain. Just connect your wallet and play. It\u2019s transparent, fast, and most importantly, fair.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 What Problem Are We Solving?\n\nWhile trying out some online casino platforms (Web2 and Web3), we realized a few annoying issues:\n\n- \u274c **Can you really trust them?**  \n  Most platforms are centralized. You have no clue what\u2019s happening behind the scenes \u2014 is the game fair? Who knows.\n\n- \u26fd **Gas fees suck.**  \n  On Ethereum mainnet, sometimes the gas fee is more than your actual bet. That just kills the fun.\n\n- \ud83d\udd52 **Slow payouts.**  \n  Even if you win, you\u2019re stuck waiting for your payout. Kinda ruins the vibe.\n\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Too many random tokens.**  \n  Some platforms use weird in-game tokens you have to manage or swap. It\u2019s confusing and totally unnecessary.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 What Makes MetaBet Different?\n\nWe tried to keep things simple, fast, and fair. Here\u2019s what we did differently:\n\n- \u2705 **Everything\u2019s on-chain**  \n  Every bet, win, or payout goes through smart contracts. You can actually see what\u2019s happening.\n\n- \u26a1 **Fast & cheap gameplay**  \n  Thanks to the **Base network**, games run with super low fees and almost no delays.\n\n- \ud83d\udcb8 **Instant payouts**  \n  If you win, you get paid instantly. No waiting, no middlemen.\n\n- \ud83e\ude99 **One token only**  \n  Everything runs on Base ETH. You don\u2019t need to deal with multiple tokens or in-game currencies.\n\n---\n\nThanks for checking out !\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- Syncing blockchain data with the UI and handling wallet interactions took time to get right.\n\n- I wasn't familiar with Base\u2019s OnchainKit and related SDKs initially. Understanding how they work and integrating them properly into the dApp required a lot of trial and error.\n\n- While writing smart contracts, I faced the common \"stack too deep\" error in Solidity, especially while handling games like Mines and Plinko with multiple parameters. I had to refactor the code and split logic into smaller functions.\n\n- Designing the profit system and game rewards was another challenge:\n  - **Dice**: Had to carefully balance win probabilities and multipliers to ensure fairness and sustainability.\n  - **Mines**: Implemented a dynamic reward multiplier based on how many safe tiles a user reveals.\n  - **Plinko**: Defined multipliers based on final slot positions, making sure the odds and returns were balanced.\n\n- Fine-tuning the economics of each game (like platform profit margins vs. player rewards) involved multiple iterations and on-chain testing.",

India's vibrant culture of community aid and philanthropy can be enhanced by removing intermediaries and increasing transparency through blockchain technology.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn traditional fundraising systems, intermediaries take high fees, and trust issues arise due to lack of transparency. Many small businesses and charitable organizations struggle to gather funds due to these barriers, especially in regions where financial access is limited.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nBaseFund allows anyone to create a transparent fundraiser directly on the Base blockchain. By using smart contracts, funds are only released once the target is met, ensuring accountability and trust. The platform is also accessible with lower fees, making it suitable for community-driven initiatives. This provides a cost-effective, transparent, and secure fundraising solution for communities.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart Contract Logic: One challenge was ensuring that funds are only released when the donation goal is reached. Solidity's time-based conditions required careful implementation to ensure donors are protected, which I solved using event-driven mechanisms.\nFrontend Integration with Blockchain: Integrating React with the blockchain proved tricky due to asynchronous behavior when fetching contract data. I handled this by optimizing the data fetching process with React hooks and ethers.js.\nGas Fee Optimization: Ensuring that gas fees remain minimal on the Base network was a challenge, especially when interacting with the contract during testing. I had to frequently adjust the deployment strategy and optimize contract functions to minimize unnecessary computations."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nBasePad solves the trust and payout problems that make traditional freelance platforms painful for both clients and builders.\n\n### For Bounty Creators\n- **Lock rewards onchain** instead of trusting a platform, the prize is committed upfront in **USDC on Base**, so there is no way to \u201cghost\u201d after the work is done.\n- **Simple, cheap bounty creation with x402 micropayments**, instead of complex checkout flows, creators pay a tiny **0.001 USDC x402 fee** to create a bounty.\n- **Transparent, verifiable activity**, all payments, payouts, and receipts live on Base and can be inspected onchain.\n\n### For Bounty Hunters\n- **Instant, trustless payouts**, once a submission is selected, the payout is sent directly to the hunter\u2019s wallet in **USDC on Base**.\n- **AI-assisted review of submissions**, **Gemini 2.0** helps filter low-effort submissions so creators can focus on serious entries.\n- **Onchain proof-of-work receipts**, hunters can download a neon **\u201cbounty receipt\u201d** that encodes the bounty ID, amount, hunter address, and transaction hash as portable proof of delivery.\n\n### For Onchain Builders & Teams\n- **Drop-in x402 demo**, shows how to use **HTTP 402 (Payment Required)** to gate features with onchain micropayments.\n- **Better UX than typical Web3 dApps**, Privy embedded wallets remove the \u201cinstall MetaMask first\u201d friction, and the neo-brutal UI keeps the focus on bounties and payouts.\n- **Template for onchain hackathons & micro-grants**, organizers can spin up bounties, collect submissions, and pay out transparently on Base using a familiar web-app flow.\n\n> **In short:** BasePad turns bounty work from  \n> \u201chope the platform or client pays me\u201d  \n> into  \n> \u201cterms are onchain, payouts are automatic, and everyone can verify what happened.\u201d\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### A. Getting x402 Payment Verification Truly Trustless\n\nAt first, it was tempting to trust the client-side success state from the x402 flow, but that would defeat the purpose of building onchain.\n\nThe backend needed to independently verify that:\n- The transaction actually happened on **Base Sepolia**\n- The **real USDC contract** was called\n- The **platform wallet** received at least **0.001 USDC**\n\nThe main hurdle was decoding **Transfer** event logs correctly and handling token decimals and edge cases.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Fetch the transaction receipt from a **Base Sepolia RPC**\n- Use typed log decoding (via **Viem / Ethers**) to parse `Transfer(from, to, amount)`\n- Strictly check:\n  - `to === platformWallet`\n  - `amount >= requiredAmount`\n- Only then create the bounty\n\nThis transformed the x402 flow from a nice demo into a **fully trustless onchain payment gate**.\n\n---\n\n### B. Making x402 and Embedded Wallet UX Feel Like a Normal Web App\n\nHTTP 402 responses, wallet popups, and onchain confirmations can easily feel clunky.\n\nEarly issues included:\n- x402 errors surfacing as generic **500 errors** in Next.js route handlers\n- Wallet prompts appearing at unexpected times\n- No clear distinction between **draft bounty** and **ready-to-pay** state\n\n**Solution:**\n- Introduced a **two-step bounty creation flow**:\n  1. Collect bounty details\n  2. Explicit **\u201cPay 0.001 USDC via x402\u201d** confirmation\n- Normalized the x402 backend response into clean JSON:\n  - `status`\n  - `requiredAmount`\n  - `targetAddress`\n- Added clear neo-brutalist UI states:\n  - **Awaiting payment**\n  - **Verifying onchain**\n  - **Bounty live**\n\nThis made the payment flow feel **predictable and web-native**, despite doing real onchain verification under the hood.\n\n---\n\n### C. Generating Onchain \u201cReceipts\u201d as Shareable Images\n\nThe goal was to give hunters a **downloadable, neon receipt** for every completed bounty.\n\nChallenges:\n- `html2canvas` does not play well with SSR and must run client-side\n- Heavy neo-brutal styling with dynamic data such as addresses, hashes, and timestamps\n- Consistent rendering across devices\n\n**Solution:**\n- Isolated the receipt as a `\"use client\"` React component\n- Rendered it into a dedicated DOM node\n- Used `html2canvas` with:\n  - Fixed background\n  - Controlled scale factor for crisp PNG output\n- Pre-formatted data:\n  - Truncated hashes and addresses\n  - Normalized timestamps\n\n**Result:**  \nA one-click, onchain-verifiable receipt that hunters can share as **proof of work and payout**.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nMusic streaming platforms today enforce ad-free access through strict subscription models that rely on specific application logic. Users must pay for full monthly subscriptions, even if they only want to listen to a few playlists or songs. This leads to overpayment and a poor user experience. When users are denied access to ad-free content, platforms provide vague or app-specific error messages. These do not clarify whether the problem is due to payment issues, subscription status, or something else. At the protocol level, there is no standard method to show that a request is valid but blocked due to unpaid access. \nThis makes payment enforcement unclear, hard to automate, and not reusable across platforms. Third-party apps, recommendation systems, and automated agents cannot reliably identify or respond to payment-required situations. Each music service has to create and manage its own paywall logic, ad-injection methods, and subscription enforcement. This duplicates effort and fragments the ecosystem. This strict, subscription-first method creates a system that is inflexible, heavily reliant on trust, and out of step with how modern users behave. This is especially true for working professionals who listen to music briefly and frequently but do not want costly subscriptions. Without protocol-level payment signaling and pay-per-use access, music platforms cannot provide fair, clear, and adaptable micro-payment options for ad-free listening.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAs the goal was to submit ideas, I did not face many problems. However, while understanding the technology behind X402 and the facilitators, I found it a bit difficult. The three workshops conducted by the FBI cleared my doubts.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Problem: **Finding truly authentic and relevant local recommendations is a persistent challenge. Existing platforms often rely on static, structured data that can be outdated, overly commercialized, or simply miss the vibrant, real-time pulse of a city. Users are often left sifting through generic reviews or sponsored content, struggling to find places that genuinely resonate with local experiences and current trends. Imagine planning a trip or even just a night out, and feeling unsure if the \"top-rated\" restaurant is truly a local gem or just has a great marketing budget. This disconnect leads to missed opportunities and less fulfilling local experiences.\n\n**Our Solution -** LocalGuru with Farcaster Integration: LocalGuru bridges this gap by offering a hybrid location discovery experience. We don't just give you the \"official story\" from structured databases; we enrich it with the authentic, real-time voice of the community through Farcaster.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Challenge 1:** Navigating Neynar API Nuances & Limitations\nObstacle: The Neynar API, while powerful for accessing Farcaster data, has its specific constraints, such as strict rate limits (e.g., 1-10 results for certain queries) and evolving endpoint behaviors. Early on, we encountered 404 errors, \"ExceededMaxLimit\" issues, and \"Route not found\" errors, which hampered our ability to reliably fetch relevant social data. Simply querying with combined search terms often yielded zero results due to the specificity.\n**Our Solution:** Multi-Strategy Robust Search & Fallbacks: We didn't just fix the endpoints; we engineered a sophisticated, multi-layered search strategy within our FarcasterClient.\n\n**Challenge 2: **Reliable Location Extraction from Unstructured Social Text\nObstacle: Farcaster posts are free-form text. Reliably identifying and extracting specific, geocodable location names from this unstructured data is a significant NLP challenge. Our initial API-based location extraction (/api/extract-location-names) occasionally faced 500 errors or couldn't extract locations from more nuanced cast texts. This meant even if we found relevant casts, they wouldn't appear on the map or in the location list.\n**Our Solution:** Graceful Degradation & Multi-Source Location Fallbacks: We implemented a robust fallback system for location data",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nBefore the project, people struggled with getting authentic feedback on their Web3 and blockchain project ideas, especially from industry leaders like Jesse Pollak. \n\nEarly-stage builders faced several challenges:\n\n- Limited access to expert insights from prominent figures in the space\n- Difficulty receiving timely feedback during crucial development phases\n- No easy way to share and validate ideas before committing significant resources\n- Missing the opportunity to \"mint belief\" in promising concepts and create onchain artifacts of early supporter confidence\n- Lack of a dedicated feedback mechanism tailored specifically for Base Batches participants and onchain builders\n\nJesseGPT solves these problems by democratizing access to Jesse Pollak-style feedback, creating a unique channel for idea validation, and building a bridge between concept and community support through Zora minting. \n\nIt transforms what was once a rare opportunity (getting feedback from the creator of Base) into an accessible resource that's available 24/7 for builders.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding JesseGPT was an adventure into uncharted territory, with several technical and creative hurdles along the way:\n\n- Voice Authenticity: Getting the AI to truly sound like Jesse proved challenging initially. The first versions felt robotic and lacked Jesse's distinctive cadence and energy. We overcame this by fine-tuning the voice cloning parameters, reducing speech speed, and making subtle adjustments to pitch and emphasis patterns until the voice captured Jesse's unique speaking style.\n\n- Personality Calibration: Creating an AI that \"jesses\" authentically required extensive prompt engineering. Early versions either felt too generic or caricatured. We solved this by developing distinct personality models for both the optimistic and brutally honest Jesse variants, refining them through iterative testing until feedback genuinely reflected Jesse's thought patterns and communication style.\n\n- Crypto Vocabulary Recognition: Standard speech-to-text services struggled with recognizing Web3 terminology like \"wagmi,\" \"Farcaster,\" and \"onchain.\" We implemented custom word detection improvements in Deepgram's API to recognize crypto-native vocabulary, significantly enhancing the conversation experience for builders using industry jargon.\n\n- Dependency Deprecation: Mid-development, we discovered that 'ipfs-http-client' (a critical dependency) was deprecated, requiring a substantial refactor. We navigated this setback by migrating to 'kubo-rpc-client,' which required rewriting significant portions of the IPFS integration code but ultimately resulted in more stable performance.\n\n- Zora Integration Complexity: Deploying smart contracts through AppKit using the Zora SDK presented unexpected challenges due to unclear documentation. We spent several days troubleshooting wagmi configuration issues, eventually solving them by reverse-engineering examples and creating a custom implementation that properly interfaced with Zora's protocol.\n\nEach challenge ultimately strengthened the project, pushing us to create more robust solutions that enhanced JesseGPT's functionality and user experience.",

Patient Ownership of Medical Data\n   Traditionally, hospitals and clinics store patient records, limiting patient access.  \n   Our solution gives users full control over their own medical data via blockchain.\n\n2. Secure & Tamper-Proof Storage \n    Medical records are vulnerable to hacks, leaks, and data breaches in centralized systems.  \n    Blockchain ensures immutable and secure storage, reducing risks.\n\n3. Seamless & Efficient Data Sharing \n   Healthcare providers often have incompatible systems, causing delays in accessing patient history.  \n   Our platform enables **instant, encrypted** medical data sharing via IPFS & smart contracts.\n\n4. Fair Compensation for Medical Data  \n   Currently, users don\u2019t get paid when their data is used for research or AI training.  \n   Our system rewards users with Privy tokens when they share anonymized medical data.\n\n5. AI-Powered Data Pricing  \n    Medical data varies in value based on factors like age, health conditions, and risk factors**.  \n   Our AI-driven model calculates a fair price dynamically for each dataset.\n\n6 . Blockchain-Powered Data Authenticity**  \n   Fake medical records and insurance fraud are common issues.  \n   Smart contracts verify ownership and ensure authenticity before any transaction.\n\n7. Privacy-Preserving Data Marketplace  \n   Traditional health systems often misuse or sell patient data without consent.  \n   Users have full control over who accesses their medical records.\n\n8. Revolutionizing Medical Research & AI Innovations\n   Medical researchers struggle to find real-world, high-quality datasets. \n   Our marketplace provides decentralized, diverse, and accurate medical data for AI/ML models. \ud83d\ude80\n\n 9 . On-Chain Transactions for Transparency \nBuying and selling medical data often lacks transparency and trust.\nEthereum smart contracts enable secure, automated, and traceable payments, ensuring fair compensation and fraud prevention in transactions.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThroughout the development of this project, we faced several challenges, including:\n\nUnderstanding and Implementing Web3: As Web3 is a relatively new technology, integrating blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized features was initially complex. We had to spend a considerable amount of time understanding its fundamentals and ensuring smooth implementation.\n\nEnsuring Security: Security was a top priority, especially with handling sensitive user data in a decentralized environment. Protecting data against potential threats while ensuring the integrity of the blockchain was challenging.\n\nCross-Platform Compatibility: Ensuring that the project would run seamlessly across various devices and browsers presented some technical hurdles. We had to ensure compatibility and smooth user experience despite different platforms.\n\nUser Interface (UI) Design: Designing a UI that was both functional and user-friendly in the context of Web3 posed challenges. We had to balance modern design with ease of use, particularly for users who may not be familiar with decentralized technologies.\n\nSmart Contract Deployment: Testing and deploying smart contracts without risking loss of assets or funds was challenging. We had to test the contracts rigorously in a safe environment before moving to the live environment.\nDespite these challenges, the project was an excellent learning experience and helped us push the boundaries of what we could achieve with Web3 technology.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nIn an era where code is currency, we realized that brilliant projects often go unnoticed simply due to poor documentation or lackluster presentation. Developers spend weeks building incredible tools, but their work rarely speaks for itself in a way non-technical stakeholders or recruiters can grasp. *Nebula* was born from this realization \u2014 a desire to *amplify developer narratives*, turning raw code into eloquent, compelling stories that resonate with both machines and humans. The inspiration stemmed from our own struggles in hackathons and open-source contributions where documentation became a bottleneck.  \n\n*Nebula* is an intelligent platform that ingests a GitHub repository and *transmutes it into rich, multi-modal content*. It auto-generates:\n- *README files*\n- *LinkedIn articles*\n- *Twitter posts*\n- *Pitch deck presentations*\n- *Web3-compatible exports*\n- An *AI-powered chat* that dissects the codebase to suggest improvements, uncover vulnerabilities, and brainstorm new features.\n\nIn essence, Nebula converts your silent lines of code into a *resonant digital narrative*.\n\n## How we built it\n\nWe engineered Nebula using a modular architecture combining:\n\n- *GitHub API* and *Gitingist* to fetch and parse repository contents  \n- *LLAMA 3.3 70B VERSATILE MODEL AND GEMINI 2.5 FLASH* to summarize, analyze, and generate structured content  \n- *LangChain* for intelligent prompt chaining and document embedding  \n- *TailwindCSS* and *Next.js* for a sleek, performant frontend  \n- A backend powered by *Node.js* with a microservice handling *Web3 IPFS publishing*  \n- AI chat capabilities with context-aware memory for iterative feedback and suggestions\n- THIRDWEB for providing the ultimate article publish facilities \n- Facilities for the author of the articles to withdraw their earnings as well\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- *Abstract summarization of complex codebases* proved arduous, especially when lacking comments or structure.  \n- Balancing *conciseness and comprehensiveness* in the generated content was intellectually taxing.  \n- Integrating with *Web3 (IPFS publishing)* had steep learning curves in terms of security, persistence, and interoperability.  \n- Maintaining *contextuality* within AI chat flows across multiple modules tested the limits of token management and prompt engineering.  \n- Limited time in the hackathon compressed what could have been weeks of fine-tuning into a few sleepless nights.\n\n## What we learned\n\n- The power of *structured prompting* and intelligent chaining in LLMs cannot be overstated.  \n- Developer tools don't just need functionality \u2014 they need *empathy and accessibility*.  \n- Understanding code is one thing; *communicating code* is a whole different art form.  \n- Web3 integration isn't just hype \u2014 it offers *meaningful decentralization* of developer portfolios.  \n- Building under constraints forces *creative prioritization* and *ruthless MVP discipline*.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nInvite Codes to get access to live app\n594PSL\n85078M\n473S87\n\nHedging in crypto remains prohibitively expensive due to high volatility of digital assets, combined with the speculative, short-term focus of most token ecosystems. This problem is especially acute for ETH holders and the $93B+ locked in ETH-backed derivatives such as LSDs, LP tokens, and staked collateral. \n\nWe have built on-chain Credit Default Swaps that lets ETH holders hedge above volatility at 0 upfront cost while borrowing Autonomint USDA+ stablecoin. Hedging fees are deducted from the loan value, not the user\u2019s pocket. Liquidity providers earn yield from option premiums and ETH upside, with downside risk capped at 20%\n\nThe idea originated during my time as Head of Growth at LAToken, where I noticed a shortage of call option or put option writers due to permissionless non-KYC environment which creates a high counterparty risk for option sellers/writers. In TradFi, there is some assurance for counterparty risk but not in permissionless crypto and the only other way is to overcollateralize it. So, we created a product that simplifies participation using stablecoins by making hedging more accessible, with very low upfront hedging costs and seamless liquidity by lowering down the downside risks to 20%. \n\nAlso, currently Deribit is the dominant player in crypto options today, primarily due to its ability to attract institutional option writers through strict KYC and compliance. However, this model excludes a large segment of on-chain users who lack access to such infrastructure. Instead of competing head-on to build seller-side liquidity, we take a different approach, we will enable anyone to access deeply discounted put options at 60\u201370% lower costs using our stablecoins and on-chain CDS mechanism. This opens up a new market. Our model also creates an arbitrage opportunity for Deribit\u2019s existing option writers, who can buy cheaper hedges from us and sell them at a premium on Deribit. This strategy will allow us to tap into existing liquidity while solving the accessibility and cost problem for on-chain users.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding this product required intense mathematical modeling and multiple architectural iterations. The main goal was to keep the system fully on-chain and decentralised, shifting only time-sensitive operations (like 15-second checks) to the backend. Balancing decentralization with low gas fees, fast execution, and smooth admin operations was a major challenge.\n\nOne of the toughest problems was designing the dCDS fund logic. Each new deposit or withdrawal affects every other user's position, requiring continuous recalculation of user-specific parameters across the pool. Doing this off-chain would\u2019ve been easier, but we aimed for full decentralization. So, we developed a global cumulative function architecture where all user balances and ownership are discounted to present value, allowing us to standardize fractional shifts in pool ownership efficiently. It was like creating a new way of handling Liquidity Pool user positions in some AMMs but instead of AMM, we have this derivative-based dCDS pool. \n\nWe also needed to handle liquidations, hedging triggers, and price shocks in real time for volatile collateral. This took some of our time to figure out a low latency backend that supports on-chain events while preserving the decentralized structure.\n\nAnother major objective was creating a dynamic, modular architecture so new stablecoins or volatile assets can be onboarded into dCDS seamlessly. This meant integrating oracle feeds, ODOS for smart routing, and auto-configuring backend/frontends to reflect changes within a few instructions. This was quite a challenging part as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve also integrated Symmio for hedging via derivatives and intent-based solvers, ODOS for optimal execution, Synthetix on Base for taking hedging positions, LayerZero for OApp cross-chain messaging, and OFT for omnichain asset transfers. Testing and synchronizing all these systems, while accounting for edge cases, variable spreads, platform fees, and potential integration failures, required numerous iterative cycles and robust fallback logic.\n\nAnother challenge was running a holistic simulation of a wide variety of parameters to test the resiliency of the stablecoin peg, dCDS users returns, stablecoin backing, dCDS Pool utilisation at any point of time for providing Hedging Protection, Effect of liquidations on volatile periods. I needed to create a beast of a model to test this and the product performed beautifully in all scenarios.\n\nAlso, there are some derivative spread stategies that is only possible through our product across the entire Defi space. It involves user buying a cheap hedge from us and selling a pricey put option on Deribit derivative exchange or others and making a profit on the spreads. This is only possible through Autonomint design. Since no intent or solver infra supports such option-based strategies yet, we had to build it ourselves. So, I have to literally convince solvers like Rasa Capital and Perpshub to help facilitate option derivative spreads based user intents and we created custom APIs that allow users to place and execute these derivative intents, effectively building new infra from the ground up to support this use case.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are relentless builders, driven to tackle real-world challenges with bold, transformative solutions that empower communities and decentralized finance ecosytem.\n\nWe are participating in Based India because it offers the perfect platform to build and showcase Splitsure, our decentralized expense-sharing app, to a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. India is embracing decentralized technologies, and Base provides the infrastructure we need to develop a scalable solution that addresses trust and accountability in expense management.\n\nBy joining Based India, we aim to be part of a thriving community of innovators and developers, gaining valuable feedback, mentorship, and resources to refine and improve Splitsure. This opportunity allows us to connect with early adopters in the Indian blockchain space, ensuring that our product meets the needs of users seeking transparent, decentralized solutions.\n\nIndia's fintech space is ripe for disruption, and we see Based India as an ideal stage to introduce Splitsure to a broader audience. Our mission is to contribute to the future of decentralized applications, solving real-world financial challenges while building trust and accountability through blockchain.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nGroup finances often become a tangle of complexity, with social dynamics and trust issues compounding the problem. With Splitsure on Base, we're tackling this head-on by making financial fairness simple, transparent, and frictionless. \n\nWe\u2019re creating a trustless system with a reputation score for sure-shot settlement guarantee.\n\nWith Splitsure, we are addressing several key challenges in peer-to-peer debt management and repayment tracking, particularly in the decentralized space.\n\nTrust and Accountability: In traditional platforms, users often delay payments or fail to repay their share, causing friction in personal relationships. We aim to mitigate this by introducing a reputation score\u2014a decentralized trust metric that incentivizes timely payments. Users' scores will dynamically adjust based on their repayment history, creating a social contract where one's ability to participate in future splits depends on maintaining a good reputation.\n\nTransparency and Fairness: Financial transparency is often a challenge in group transactions. By leveraging blockchain, we ensure that all transactions are immutable, transparent, and verifiable. Splitsure provides a clear and permanent record of all bill splits, removing ambiguity and disputes over who owes what.\n\nDecentralized Ownership: Traditional platforms control user data, but we aim to empower users by allowing them to own their financial data. Using Base blockchain ensures data privacy, security, and autonomy. Users can track their expenses and payments without intermediaries, making the system more secure and decentralized.\n\nAdoption Barriers in Crypto: We recognize the barrier to entry for users unfamiliar with crypto. To address this, we're working on base to creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface that abstracts away the complexity of blockchain interactions while maintaining the benefits of decentralization, making it accessible even to non-technical use. Thanks to base smart wallets!\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nSplitsure tackles key challenges in decentralized peer-to-peer debt management with innovative solutions:\n\nReputation Score for Accountability: The unique feature of Splitsure is its reputation score, which enforces timely payback. Users\u2019 scores adjust based on their repayment behavior, incentivizing prompt payments. A lower score limits their ability to join future group splits, adding social pressure and accountability, directly addressing the common issue of delayed repayments.\n\nBlockchain-Based Transparency: By utilizing the Base blockchain, Splitsure ensures that all transactions are fully transparent and immutable. This decentralized ledger eliminates disputes over contributions or payments. Every transaction is publicly verifiable, ensuring that splits are fair and tamper-proof.\n\nDecentralized Ownership: Unlike traditional platforms that control user data, Splitsure offers complete decentralized ownership. Users maintain full control over their financial data, enhancing privacy and security. No central authority can alter or monetize the information, empowering users within the system.\n\nUser-Friendly Design for Accessibility: One major challenge in crypto adoption is complexity. Splitsure overcomes this with a simple, intuitive user interface that abstracts blockchain technology. Users interact with the app just like any traditional expense-sharing tool, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency or blockchain operations, thanks to base smart wallets!\n\nBy addressing these challenges\u2014accountability, transparency, data control, and ease of use\u2014Splitsure provides a more trustworthy, fair, and user-friendly approach to expense sharing on a decentralized platform.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIn building Splitsure, we faced several key challenges:\n\nSmart Contract Design: One of the main hurdles was designing smart contracts that enforce payments and manage reputation scores effectively. It required careful planning to ensure that the logic behind splitting bills and tracking payments was secure, efficient, and fair across different user interactions.\n\nUser Experience: Simplifying the blockchain experience for non-crypto users was another challenge. We wanted to abstract complex blockchain interactions so users could focus on splitting expenses without needing a deep understanding of the underlying technology. Balancing ease of use with decentralization proved to be tricky.\n\nReputation System: Creating a reliable reputation score system involved figuring out how to balance incentives and penalties. The system needed to be robust enough to encourage timely payments while preventing potential abuse or gaming of the score.\n\nGas Fees: Managing transaction costs on the Base blockchain was a challenge. While blockchain provides transparency and decentralization, the gas fees for on-chain transactions could become a burden, so we had to optimize smart contract interactions to minimize costs.\n\nAdoption and Onboarding: Getting users comfortable with the idea of a decentralized platform was another challenge. Blockchain is still new to many people, and explaining the benefits while onboarding them smoothly was a significant focus area.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nReputation Score System\nWe introduced a unique Reputation Score to incentivize responsible behavior. Users earn points by promptly settling debts and lose points for overdue payments. This feature fosters trust within the community, ensuring a more reliable user base.\n\nHow it works?\n1. Being Owed?: When others owe you money, your score increases. The more you manage, the higher your reputation grows\n2. Owe Money?: When others owe you money, your score increases. The more you manage, the higher your reputation grows\n3. Multiple Splits: Manage more than one expense? Your score balances over time based on how you handle being owed and owing.\n\nWe have integrated basenames, so that the reputation is publicaly visible, ensuring the participants to payback on time!\n\nDynamic Split Management\nEnhanced our splitting mechanism to allow users to adjust splits dynamically, accommodating changes in group expenses. This feature enables real-time updates, providing a smoother experience for users as circumstances evolve.\n\nIntegration with Wallets\nThanks to base smart wallets, creating and interacting with the dapp is a breeze and feels like a web2 app. Onboarding web2 users to web3 without friction!",

I used ThirdWeb templates and rigorous testing to ensure robust code.\n\nUser Experience with Blockchain: Integrating Metamask in a user-friendly way was tricky. I addressed this by creating clear onboarding steps and using Tailwind CSS for a smooth UI.\n\nGas Fees and Network Latency: High fees and delays were concerns. I explored Layer 2 solutions to reduce costs and provided real-time transaction feedback.\n\nSecurity Measures: Protecting user data and funds was crucial. I implemented input validation, encryption, and followed Solidity security best practices.\n\nThirdWeb and React Integration: Combining ThirdWeb with React was a learning curve. I relied on documentation and community support to streamline the integration.\n\nThese challenges helped me build a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for Ryuchain.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nDuring the Buildathon, I focused on enhancing Ryuchain with several new features to improve functionality and user experience:\n\nMilestone-Based Fund Release: I implemented a milestone-based funding system using Solidity smart contracts, ensuring that funds are only released when specific project goals are met. This feature adds transparency and trust for backers.\n\nLayer 2 Integration: To reduce gas fees and enhance transaction speed, I integrated Layer 2 solutions, making the dapp more cost-effective for users without compromising security.\n\nImproved User Interface: I revamped the UI using Tailwind CSS, creating a cleaner and more intuitive design. The onboarding process was streamlined to guide new users through connecting their Metamask wallets.\n\nReal-Time Transaction Feedback: Added real-time feedback for transaction statuses, providing users with updates on their contributions, which improves engagement and trust in the platform.\n\nThese enhancements made Ryuchain more secure, efficient, and user-friendly, aligning with the Buildathon's goal of creating impactful blockchain solutions.",

Joining Web3 developer communities was key to gaining quick insights and resolving issues faster.\n2. Mismatched Tool Versions\n\nChallenge: Mismatched versions of various tools and libraries (e.g., ethers.js, Hardhat, Solidity) created compatibility issues that delayed development. For example, certain functionalities changed between ethers.js v5 and v6, leading to errors.\nSolution: I resolved this by carefully checking documentation for version-specific changes and sticking to stable versions of the development stack. Using package managers like npm to lock specific versions helped maintain consistency across the project. I also wrote unit tests to ensure functionality didn\u2019t break when upgrades were necessary.\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nChallenge: Writing robust and secure smart contracts is essential in blockchain applications. Ensuring that the donation mechanism worked correctly while preventing security vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy attacks was a significant challenge.\nSolution: I followed best practices for Solidity development, such as using the nonReentrant modifier to prevent re-entrancy attacks and ensuring proper gas optimization. Rigorous unit testing with Hardhat was crucial to ensuring the smart contracts performed as expected in various scenarios.\n4. User Experience (UX) in a Decentralized Ecosystem\n\n## Additional Features\n\nBase Integration: Integrated with Base for low-cost, fast micro-donations.\nFlagging System: Added a community-driven flagging system for content and user moderation.\nUser Dashboards: Created dashboards for authors to track donations and for supporters to view their contribution history.\nAdvanced Search: Implemented search functionality for articles by tags, categories, and text.\nUpvote/Downvote System: Introduced community voting to promote quality content.\nSmart Contract Enhancements: Optimized contracts for better gas efficiency and real-time donation tracking.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nIndia's dynamic digital landscape and emerging blockchain industry present a great opportunity to drive adoption of decentralized technologies. I believe that contributing to the Base ecosystem can empower communities by creating trustless systems like decentralized escrow services. India is rapidly moving toward digital solutions, and blockchain can solve critical issues related to trust and financial security.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe challenge we are addressing is the lack of trust in peer-to-peer transactions and the need for secure financial intermediaries. In many cases, individuals and small businesses cannot afford traditional escrow services, and there is a risk of fraud in transactions without a trusted intermediary. The absence of transparency and the high cost of centralized escrow services also limit accessibility for a large portion of the population.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur Decentralized Escrow Service offers a trustless, smart contract-based solution that allows secure transactions between buyers and sellers. This solution eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and provides transparency through the Base blockchain. By enabling buyers, sellers, and arbiters to manage disputes without third-party intervention, this system fosters trust in a fair and transparent way, empowering individuals and small businesses to engage in digital commerce.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe faced challenges integrating smart contracts with the frontend, particularly ensuring seamless interaction between MetaMask and the Base network. Initially, there were difficulties with contract deployment due to gas limitations and network incompatibilities, which were resolved by optimizing the contract\u2019s bytecode and tweaking network configurations in Hardhat. On the frontend, managing asynchronous interactions with the blockchain was tricky, especially for transaction confirmations, but we overcame this by implementing clear UI state management and robust error handling."

Back then, our education was filled with bright colors, fun poems, and engaging 3D activities that captured our imagination. But as we grew up, education often became dry and uninspiring\u2014textbooks, dull lectures, and endless online articles. It's no wonder so many of us lost the spark for learning.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThis realization inspired us to create Visisphere\u2014a website that aims to transform the learning experience by bringing back the engagement, excitement, and interactivity of our early years. Visisphere offers immersive, 3D lessons designed to be visually stimulating and deeply engaging, tailored to high school and university students. Users can search for what they want to learn, and if it's not available, they can request new content directly.\n\nPrimarily targets high school and university-level topics.\nOffers interactive 3D lessons to make complex subjects come to life.\n\n\nWe envision Visisphere as an AI-powered platform where users simply type what they want to learn, and within minutes, an interactive 3D course is generated\u2014complete with a structured syllabus, high-quality narration, and seamless interaction. During lessons, users can even ask questions directly to an AI, turning the learning experience into an engaging conversation.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe steepest challenge was jumping into animation for the first time. Learning the basics in two days, and then opening Blender to bring concepts to life was intimidating\u2014every movement required relentless searching and perseverance.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nTo implement this project in real life for the wellness of stray animals\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOn May 14th, a critical incident unfolded in Chennai where a cow urgently needed rescue. Despite the severity of the situation, the busy crowd around remained indifferent. I reported the issue to the relevant authorities, who assured me that a driver had been dispatched and would arrive shortly.\n\nHowever, it was only on the afternoon of May 15th that I received a call from the driver, inquiring about the location of the distressed animal. This considerable delay in response time underscores a critical problem: the long time taken to rescue animals in danger, serving as an act of negligence from the people\u2019s side.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nTo address these challenges and significantly reduce the response time in animal rescue operations, we propose the development of a Web3-based stake and reward system using ERC20 Tokens.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the significant challenges we faced was with the documentation for wagmi, which was somewhat disorganized and led to difficulties in implementation. To overcome this, we switched to using ethers.js, which provided more straightforward and well-documented support for our needs.\n\nAnother challenge we encountered was related to implementing an OTP-based access system. The goal was to allow the issuer to authorize the verifier to confirm whether the driver picked up the animal. This feature was crucial for ensuring that the system rewarded users correctly based on their actions. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to implement this functionality fully. Despite these hurdles, we managed to build a functional system that still meets the core objectives of our project.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nchanged some bugs and changed the token system to a better convinence",

Plus, the energy at Based India is unmatched\u2014perfect for turning bold ideas into reality!\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI'm focusing on challenges that combine privacy, decentralization, and seamless user experience. Specifically, I'm looking to tackle issues around secure data sharing, scalable smart contracts, and enhancing blockchain-based applications. The goal is to create solutions that are practical, user-friendly, and aligned with the principles of Web3.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOwnSound addresses the challenge of privacy, ownership, and monetization in the music industry by leveraging blockchain technology and advanced cryptography. By using AES encryption and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on EDU Chain, OwnSound ensures that both artists and listeners maintain full control over their content and data. The platform's decentralized infrastructure allows creators to securely distribute their music, set royalties, and benefit from transparent revenue-sharing models, while users can enjoy private playlists, rent or trade Non-Fungible Sounds (NFS), and support artists directly without intermediaries.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the key challenges we ran into was the limitation of FHEVM, which only allows the use of bytes32 values rather than strings. To overcome this, we implemented AES encryption to securely encrypt the music data and convert it into a bytes32 format, ensuring compatibility while maintaining privacy. This approach allowed us to leverage the privacy benefits of FHEVM while securely handling more complex data structures like music files and metadata.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nFirst thing, i really like the Base Chain. The other is that NebulaID is very consumer focussed application which is made for everyone ( web2 and web3 users) - and for that purpose, Base is a best chain for onboarding normal web2 users and web3 users at the same time for the universal Identity creation. \n\nNebulaID is an open-source, standardized protocol for decentralized identity verification designed to seamlessly integrate with Base blockchain and other EVM based chains. Right now, we have implemented initial version using TLS Notary, Semaphore, ZKP, ENS verification, FHE for sensitive sharable data and Worldcoin for different types of verification for users profile and many more things.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\n## Overview\n\nNebulaID introduces a novel approach to digital identity verification by combining blockchain technology with satellite networks. The protocol allows users to create and manage their digital identities across multiple platforms and blockchain networks while retaining control over their personal data. By integrating zero-knowledge proofs, NebulaID can verify user claims without revealing sensitive information, ensuring robust security and privacy. The use of Base as the underlying blockchain provides a secure foundation for the protocol, enabling smart contract-based identity management that is transparent, immutable, and efficient. \nIdeation - Developed as a response to the need for enhanced digital identity systems, the project emerged after taking inspiration from the Starship hackathon idea by SpaceX for the need of interplanteray identity verification protocol on blockchain. NebulaID aims to redefine identity management by leveraging a constellation of satellites to provide blockchain-based digital IDs for individuals and assets on planet Earth and more, enhancing both security and privacy in digital transactions, health records and user nationality and other types of verification.\n\n## Key Features and Objectives\n\n1. **Decentralized Identity Management**: NebulaID enables users to maintain control over their digital identities, supporting cross-chain compatibility and interoperability across different platforms including cross-chain ENS verification. \n\n2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Privacy**: The protocol utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to verify identity-related claims without disclosing any personal information, safeguarding user privacy and data.\n\n3. **Satellite Network Integration**: By employing a network of satellites, NebulaID offers a secure, decentralized infrastructure for digital identity verification that is less prone to terrestrial risks like hacking or data breaches.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\n4. **Multi-Planet Digital Identity**: As satellite coverage expands, NebulaID aims to provide identity verification services not just on Earth but also in space, catering to future multi-planetary digital economies.\n\n5. **Credit Verification and Scoring**: With NebulaID, users can link their digital identities to credit histories and scores, allowing for instant credit verification and evaluation. This is especially useful in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, where trust and transparency are paramount. Lenders can verify creditworthiness without accessing sensitive personal information, ensuring privacy and data security.\n\n6. **Health and Medical Records Management**: NebulaID can securely manage digital health records using FHE - providing secure access of data to selected addresses by  the users, enabling healthcare providers to access verified medical histories while ensuring patient confidentiality. This is vital in scenarios like medical emergencies, where quick access to accurate data can save lives. \n\n7. **Asset Management and Ownership Verification**: NebulaID facilitates secure and verifiable proof of ownership for assets such as real estate, vehicles, and digital assets. This reduces fraud and disputes in transactions involving property and other high-value items.\n\n8. **Enhanced Security and Resilience**: The integration of blockchain technology with satellite networks creates a system resistant to single points of failure, offering a highly secure and reliable digital ID solution.\n\nNebulaID directly addresses the need for a robust digital ID infrastructure without storing any user data - just verifying the data on users system.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nFaced some challenges such as -\n\n1. Development of different type of verification plugin for TLSNotary like Twitter Profile Verification and Farcaster Profile Proof. \n\n2. Secure data storage which can be shared with wallet selected by user ( like for medical data - user can directly add doctors address and can share sensitive infomation etc)\n\n3. Implementing Web2 credit score system of user is kinda tough - it hard to get data direclty from trusted provider for user to verify it. Earlier using TLSNotary to verify credit score directly on Credit service website - but the process gives Credit score after few days - which cant be easily verified with TLS Notary. \n\n4. Also implementing Nationailty verification on basis of passport is kinda tricky - rn we are just doing verification for Indian Adhaar holders on chain.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n## System Architecture and Components\n\n1. **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Base, NebulaID employs smart contracts written in Solidity to automate digital identity management, including creation, updating, access control, and revocation. The use of Base ensures a permissionless environment, enhancing transparency and security.\n\n2. **Satellite Network Design**: The NebulaID satellite constellation functions as a decentralized network, where each satellite acts as a node in the blockchain system. This setup provides a resilient infrastructure for secure digital ID storage, synchronization, and verification.\n\n3. **Decentralized Storage and Transmission**: Utilizing decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, NebulaID ensures that digital IDs are stored securely and redundantly, avoiding reliance on centralized servers. Advanced encryption methods (e.g., SHA-256 and AES) are used to protect data during transmission, maintaining high levels of security.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Data Integrity**: To combat the challenges of space, such as radiation and latency, NebulaID incorporates radiation-hardened components and advanced error-correcting codes. These measures ensure data integrity and reliability, even in the harsh conditions of space.",

Our application has a high throughput of transactions as multiple users are generating responses from LLMs concurrently and Base helps us to make that possible with very cheap gas and fast finality as it provides the security of Ethereum with scalability.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are trying to make using LLMs cheap and affordable for everyone to use out there. Be it for large data analysis, or some day-to-day queries. You can select from various LLMs that are designed for each specific task and you only pay as much as you use that model. No need to subscribe monthly to 10 different models for dealing with different work.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur platform solves this problem by allowing users to use any model of their choice depending on their use cases and pay as they use it. We provide a suite of LLMs and a great user interface to know how much a certain is prompt going to cost the user, a dashboard to show the token usage analytics, and much more. The best part about this is that the user pays with crypto and not fiat which makes it more accessible to everyone. We have our own ERC-20 token called \u201cBOD\u201d which users can buy with their stablecoin like USDC. We use Base as our layer 2 which makes our transactions fast and efficient while having the security of a blockchain like Ethereum.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nProblem 1:  Obtaining real USDC on a test net for development can be difficult.\nSolution: Deploy your own ERC-20 token that mimics USDC's behavior for testing purposes.\nProblem 2:  Solidity's lack of native floating-point numbers can make financial calculations challenging.\nSolution: Use fixed-point arithmetic, decimal libraries, or rational numbers to represent decimals accurately.",

Integrating Centralized & Decentralized Rails\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  TradFi APIs (bank-grade settlement) and on-chain protocols follow different data models and compliance requirements.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Built a modular **\u201crouting\u201d layer** that abstracts each rail behind a common interface. Leveraged adapters for major banking partners and token bridges, with a **unified transaction schema** and **built-in audit trails**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Multi-Token Payroll\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  Multiple chain and tokens require different native interfaces and integrations, sometimes even new code structure.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Implemented **ERC20 wrappers** and **Native** transfer batch transactions to provide multi token support. Chain based modular configurations and option to switch back and forth between multiple chains and tokens using unified interface. ( Gasless transactions are under development )\n\n---\n\n### 3. Designing Trustless Dispute & Recovery for P2P\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  On-chain transfers are final; adding reversible logic risked centralization.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Developed a **decentralized dispute oracle mechanism**: if a recipient claims, a multi-party arbiter contract holds funds in escrow until off-chain evidence is submitted, then releases or refunds accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Designing splitting and Invoice Payments\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  On-chain bill payments are non existent and no easy way to abstract splits.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Developed a address book mechanism to keep wallets as contacts to easily split features among people. Analysed the current invoice protocols and build a secure and recoverable escrow based contract to process invoices and automatic recurring subscriptions.\n\nDecentralised oracle manages the dapp's issuing invoice to look for processed payments and service forwarding.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Compliance & Privacy (KYC/AML vs. User Data Protection)\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  Regulatory requirements demand identity checks, but full on-chain identity exposes privacy risks.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Integrated **UIDAI** and **PAN** verification API and wrappers to perform user authentication, offramp transaction's logging, audit data preservation and logs.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Maintaining Seamless UX Across Complex Workflows\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  Combining so many features risked overwhelming users.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Iterative front-end design with user testing sessions; introduced **progressive disclosure**  and a **unified dashboard** that surfaces next-step guidance.\n**Minimal** Ux and Ui allows anyone to intuitively navigate the web app and perform any action they need.",

It's very difficult to have an understanding and keep track of these parameters to save guard one from catastrophic scenarios such as Liquidations.  \n\nOne of the areas of major concern are that all the lending protocols rely on price feeds on platforms such as Chainlink, Pyth network but the limit orders offered in the DeFi space are mostly based on Pool's internal pricing mechanism which is generally have a significant delay.\n\nI have developed a prototype which offers DeFi Actions on parameters from Price Feeds such as Chainlink, Live Data from Lending Protocols to execute operations which would safe guard users from liquidation. \n\n\n## Real World Scenario \n\n### Let's Assume: \n\nI have a borrow position at Aave by depositing collateral such as (ETH, BTC, cbETH) and borrowed some USDC to do yield farming and obtain a high yield to offet by borrowing interest rate. \n\n\n### Tragic Event: (Sudden Price Drop)\n\nThe Price of these volatile assets experiences a sudden drop. As Aave, relies on platform such as Chainlink to get the data.

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThe Problem: Running a Store by Guesswork Millions of local Kirana store owners in India manage their businesses entirely by hand. They face constant challenges that hurt their profits:\n\nManual Tracking: Owners spend hours checking shelves to see what is missing.\n\nLost Sales: They often realize an item is out of stock only after a customer asks for it.\n\nWasted Money: They guess what to buy, often overstocking items that don't sell.\n\nInefficient Payments: Managing cash and negotiating prices with multiple suppliers takes up valuable time.\n\nThe Solution: SmartShelf SmartShelf replaces this manual work with an intelligent, autonomous agent. It acts like a digital manager that works 24/7 to keep the store stocked.\n\nInstead of a human checking inventory, SmartShelf automates the entire loop:\n\nSmart Monitoring: It watches stock levels in real-time.\n\nAI Decisions: It uses Google Gemini Pro to analyze sales history and decide exactly how much to reorder, removing the guesswork.\n\nAuto-Negotiation: It autonomously connects with suppliers using a simulated Agent-to-Agent (A2A) network to find the best deals.\n\nInstant Settlement: It executes secure, verifiable payments immediately on the Base Sepolia blockchain using the x402 protocol.\n\nBy handling these tasks automatically, SmartShelf prevents stockouts and frees up the shopkeeper to focus on their customers rather than logistics.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Making the AI Speak \"Code\" The biggest challenge was that Google Gemini sometimes replied with extra conversational text (like \"Here is your plan\") instead of just the data we needed. This broke our app.\n\nSolution: We wrote a simple \"cleanup\" function that strips away the extra text and forces the AI to give us only clean, usable JSON data.\n\n2. Browser Security Blocks (CORS) We ran into a security issue where the browser blocked our \"Store\" app from reading the payment proof (x-payment-hash) sent by the \"Supplier\" server.\n\nSolution: We had to configure our backend specifically to \"expose\" this header so our frontend could verify the blockchain transaction legally.\n\n3. AI Model Availability We initially tried using specific faster AI models, but they weren't available in our region, causing 404 errors that crashed the agent.\n\nSolution: We built a fallback system and switched to the stable Gemini Pro model to ensure the agent always works, even if one model is down.\n\n4. Syncing Two Dashboards We wanted the Supplier Dashboard to update instantly when the Store Agent placed an order. Connecting two separate apps in real-time was tricky.\n\nSolution: We created a shared backend memory and used \"polling\" (checking every 2 seconds) to make sure the Supplier sees new orders the moment they happen.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nToday AI agents are powerful at reasoning but incapable of participating in the real economy.\n\nMost valuable data, APIs and services on the web sit behind paywalls, subscriptions, API keys or private licensing deals. This creates a fundamental mismatch:\n\n- AI agents need instant, per-request access\n- Web services need reliable, fair monetization\n- Users want agents to complete real tasks end-to-end without manual setup\n\nAs a result:\n\n- Agents either scrape content without paying or stop at paywalls\n- Small, high-quality API and data providers cannot monetize AI usage\n- Users must manually manage accounts, keys and subscriptions\n- Autonomous workflows break the moment payment is required\n\nWhat People Can Use x402-agentOS For - \n\nx402-agentOS enables AI agents to pay for value as they work, making previously blocked tasks possible.\n\n**1. For Users**\n\n- Delegate complex tasks (research, market analysis, summaries) to an AI agent\n- Set a budget (e.g. $0.50) and let the agent decide what\u2019s worth paying for\n- Get higher-quality paid insights instead of free scraped results\n- See exactly what was paid for, how much and why\n\nExample:\n\n\u201cGive me a crypto market briefing using on-chain data and social sentiment.\u201d\nThe agent automatically pays multiple APIs via x402 and returns a single, composed answer.\n\n**2. For Developers & Data Providers**\n\n- Monetize APIs and services instantly via pay-per-request\n- No subscriptions, API keys or billing dashboards required\n- Earn directly from AI agents using USDC on Base\n- Reach a growing market of autonomous agents by default\n\n**3. For the AI & x402 Ecosystem**\n\n- Demonstrates a real agent-native payment workflow\n- Replaces scraping with pay-per-use\n- Enables a sustainable economic model for the AI-driven web\n- Acts as a reference implementation for x402-powered agent commerce\n\n**Why This Is Safer & Better Than Existing Approaches**\n\n- No centralized accounts or credentials \u2192 fewer security risks\n- No upfront subscriptions \u2192 users pay only for value delivered\n- Transparent on-chain settlement \u2192 auditable and trust-minimized\n- Autonomous decision-making \u2192 agents reason about cost vs. utility\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building x402-agentOS, the biggest challenges were not UI or agent logic but making autonomous payments reliable, interpretable and composable in a real-world setting.\n\n**1. Handling 402 Responses Across Multiple Services**\n\nEach x402-enabled API can return slightly different payment requirements, metadata and expectations. Early on the agent treated 402 responses as a simple blocking error, which broke multi-step workflows.\n\nHow I solved it:\n\n- Treated 402 Payment Required as a first-class signal, not an exception\n- Built a small abstraction that normalizes 402 responses (price, chain, asset, facilitator)\n- Allowed the agent to reason about whether to pay before proceeding\n\nThis made it possible to chain multiple paid requests in a single task.\n\n**2. Making the Agent Payment-Aware (Cost vs. Value)**\n\nA major hurdle was preventing the agent from blindly paying for every request. Without constraints, this leads to unnecessary spend and poor user trust.\n\nHow I solved it:\n\n- Introduced a user-defined budget cap (e.g. $0.50)\n- Forced the agent to evaluate price vs. expected utility before signing a payment\n- Logged every payment decision to make the agent\u2019s behavior transparent\n\nThis ensured payments were intentional and aligned with user expectations.\n\n**3. Payment Latency & User Experience**\n\nOn-chain settlement introduces latency that can break the flow of an interactive agent experience if handled naively.\n\nHow I solved it:\n\n- Used x402\u2019s facilitator flow to abstract blockchain complexity\n- Treated payments as part of the request lifecycle rather than a separate step\n- Optimized the UI to show progress and settlement status instead of blocking\n\nThis kept the experience fast while preserving on-chain guarantees.\n\n4. Debugging Agent Failures\n\nWhen an agent failed mid-task, it was initially unclear whether the issue was:\n\n- Payment failure\n- API error\n- Reasoning error\n\nHow I solved it:\n\n- Added structured logging for each step: discovery, payment, execution\n- Exposed a simple trace view showing which services were called and paid\n\nThis made failures debuggable and improved reliability significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of building x402-agentOS was not making payments but making them autonomous, explainable and composable. Solving these challenges reinforced why x402 is essential for agent-native workflows and not just another payment API.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Logistics today depends heavily on manual processes**. Finding a warehouse, verifying whether a provider is legitimate, negotiating terms, and completing payments all require human involvement. This makes logistics *slow, expensive, and difficult to scale*,especially for **short-term or urgent needs**.\n\nWhile **AI systems are already used for planning** and **optimization in supply chains**, they cannot independently book real-world logistics services. An AI cannot verify whether a service is real, whether an API truly belongs to a provider, or complete *trusted payments without human approval*. As a result, **autonomous supply chain execution is not possible today.**\n\n**Prabandh402** solves this by making logistics services machine-verifiable and machine-payable. Logistics providers publish cryptographically verifiable service identities, allowing AI agents to discover, verify, and transact with them safely. Payments are settled instantly using **HTTP-native x402** flows, removing delays and manual intervention.\n\nThis enables common logistics tasks such as short-term warehouse booking, emergency transport, and surge capacity management to be completed in seconds instead of days, with higher trust and lower cost. Prabandh402 turns logistics into infrastructure that AI systems can safely and autonomously use.\n\n\nI am attaching link to the detailed info. about the Idea: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12O6Jl2wHet7vaKyrZ4XwynA5jaJgwTO5J_3gT2Im4-c/edit?usp=sharing](Prabandh402)\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe main challenge was designing a trust model for real-world logistics services. While digital payments can be verified easily, warehouses and transport providers exist offline, making it non-trivial to create identities that AI agents can trust. I addressed this by conceptualizing the use of EIP-8004 service descriptors to cryptographically bind a provider\u2019s service, API endpoint, and payment address into a single verifiable identity.\n\nAnother challenge was avoiding unrealistic assumptions about full AI autonomy. Logistics involves compliance, liability, and financial risk, which makes complete automation impractical in the short term. I resolved this by reframing the system around hybrid autonomy, where AI agents operate within predefined rules and human oversight is applied for higher-risk transactions.\n\nFinally, defining the right scope for an initial version was difficult. Solving the entire supply chain at once would make the idea unfocused and impractical. I addressed this by narrowing the concept to spot-market logistics use cases, where instant discovery, trust, and payment provide the most immediate value.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nTinySubs solves one of the biggest missing pieces in the blockchain ecosystem \u2014 frictionless, low-cost recurring payments.\n\nTraditionally, setting up small, periodic payments (\u20b910/\u20b920/\u20b950 equivalents) is either expensive due to gas fees, requires complex smart contract setups, or forces creators and developers to rely on centralized platforms that take high cuts.\n\nTinySubs makes micro-subscriptions possible onchain by providing:\n\n- Instant, low-fee payments using smart contracts\n- Recurring billing that doesn\u2019t require manual user approval each time\n- A simple UI where creators can create subscription tiers in seconds\n- Developer-friendly APIs for integrating subscription logic into any app\n- Security-by-default, since funds flow directly from user \u2192 creator\n- No middlemen, meaning creators keep almost everything\n\nUsers can subscribe to newsletters, premium content, tools, communities, or even pay small periodic donations \u2014 fully onchain, fully automated, and completely transparent.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding TinySubs came with several technical hurdles.\nOne of the first challenges was figuring out how to model on-chain recurring micro-payments. Traditional subscriptions rely on automated off-chain billing, so translating that into a decentralized, pull-based flow required experimenting with token approvals, transfer permissions, and finding a safe pattern that doesn\u2019t compromise user control.\n\nAnother challenge was gas optimization. My earlier contract designs were functional but unnecessarily heavy. After profiling the gas usage, I had to refactor the architecture into a more modular and minimal structure, which reduced cost and made the code easier to maintain.\n\nIntegrating the frontend with smart contracts also brought difficulties. Simple actions like approving tokens or checking subscription state required careful handling of asynchronous blockchain calls, transaction confirmations, and error states. Ensuring that the UI always reflected the latest on-chain data took multiple iterations.\n\nI also ran into issues with testnet liquidity. Some networks didn\u2019t have stablecoin faucets available, which made it hard to simulate real micro-transactions. To work around this, I switched networks, used fallback tokens, and created mock flows to keep development moving without blocking the user experience.\n\nFinally, working solo meant managing both the contract layer and the full UI/UX within limited time. Balancing speed with correctness was challenging, especially while ensuring the system behaved reliably across multiple wallet combinations and test networks.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Lucra AI** solves a critical gap in the current onchain ecosystem: **intuitive, intelligent, and user-friendly crypto finance management**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 The Problem\n\n1. **Crypto Payments Are Still Technical & Rigid**\n\n   * Users need to manually enter wallet addresses, use exact tokens, and go through multiple steps to complete even simple payments.\n   * Natural-language interactions are nearly nonexistent.\n\n2. **No Personalized Finance Tools Onchain**\n\n   * Web3 lacks tools that help users **understand their spending**, **track transactions**, or receive **smart suggestions** based on usage \u2014 unlike Web2 neobanks and apps.\n\n3. **Multisend & Split Payments Are Friction-Heavy**\n\n   * Current tools don\u2019t allow easy multi-party payments from one message.\n   * Most wallets don't support splitting funds without custom scripts or contracts.\n\n4. **Chat + Payments Are Disconnected**\n\n   * No seamless blend of communication + financial action like \u201cSlack meets your wallet.\u201d\n   * Group payments, tagging, or chatting around money require external platforms or manual effort.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 How Lucra AI Solves This\n\n| Challenge                            | Lucra AI's Solution                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Manual, confusing payment UX**     | Users just *talk* to Lucra in plain English to send, split, or track funds. AI understands intent and handles logic.    |\n| **No smart spending insights**       | Lucra acts like a personal CFO \u2014 categorizing spending, surfacing reminders, and showing trends from past transactions. |\n| **Friction in multisend & split**    | Users can say \"Send 10 to @bob and @alice\" or \"Split 100 three ways\" \u2014 Lucra auto-detects and executes onchain.         |\n| **Lack of chat-native transactions** | Group chats and @tags allow money to flow naturally in conversations \u2014 just like chatting, but onchain and instant.     |\n| **Poor accessibility for newcomers** | Coinbase smart wallet + gasless UX makes it easy even for crypto novices to onboard, transact, and manage finances.     |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc In short:\n\nLucra AI replaces **forms**, **wallet toggles**, and **technical steps** with one powerful interface: **conversation**.\nIt bridges the usability of ChatGPT with the power of Base's onchain rails \u2014 and delivers the first real \u201cWeb3-native finance assistant\u201d experience.\n\n\n\nmainnet transaction - 0xe83adfea27f20d9b3419033f23bd29c48c99dcd1d2143cbf193a229679f1244e\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n# \ud83d\udee0 Challenges We Ran Into\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Challenge 1: Interpreting Natural Language into Onchain Actions\n\n**Problem:**\nParsing flexible, ambiguous chat commands like \u201csplit 10 bucks between Bob and Alice\u201d or \u201csend 5 to Jack if he\u2019s online\u201d into structured transaction logic (token, recipient, amount) was non-trivial.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe trained and fine-tuned a GPT-4-turbo-based command parser with a JSON schema constraint and fallback heuristics. We also implemented a keyword-suggestion chip bar (like ChatGPT's follow-up suggestions) to guide ambiguous inputs toward deterministic actions.\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f Challenge 2: Multi-Recipient, Gasless, Cross-Call Execution\n\n**Problem:**\nExecuting multiple token transfers in a single sponsored transaction while resolving `@handles` to wallets, calculating equal splits, and dynamically generating calldata posed contract and bundler-level challenges.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe deployed a multicall-capable smart contract that takes an array of `recipient-amount` pairs. Basename handles are resolved off-chain with caching via AgentKit, and Coinbase Paymaster is used for gasless execution via Smart Wallet.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Challenge 3: Real-Time Transaction History & Summarization\n\n**Problem:**\nRetrieving historical onchain transactions and categorizing them by purpose (e.g., donation, refund, payroll) in real time without flooding the frontend was tricky.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe indexed each user\u2019s wallet using an internal Graph node and enriched each transaction with GPT-powered summaries, emoji-tagged categories, and recipient basenames. This data was cached and surfaced via a performant REST API.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Challenge 4: Intelligent Prompt Suggestions & UI Sync\n\n**Problem:**\nMaintaining context-aware suggestions (like \u201cWant to split the bill with @group?\u201d) across multiple chat contexts caused stale UI state and memory bloat.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe integrated Zustand for global state management and coupled our suggestion engine with the GPT parser so that every intent path included next-step suggestions as part of the output schema.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd12 Challenge 5: Security & Transaction Previewing\n\n**Problem:**\nUsers were concerned about blindly signing smart wallet transactions parsed from chat.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe built a preview engine that converts parsed intent into a human-readable preview (\u201cYou\u2019re sending 5 USDC to @alice.base, gas is 0.00 ETH\u201d), which must be confirmed before signing.\n\n---\n\nLucra AI tackles both the technical complexity **and the human friction** of making onchain interactions feel intelligent, natural, and powerful.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a downloadable one-pager or Notion-ready project doc for this!",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThe Problem PayPerRead Solves\n1. Subscriptions Are Overpriced & Underutilized\n\nUsers are forced to buy full-month or yearly subscriptions even when they want to read just 1\u20132 articles.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Money wasted, low satisfaction.\n\n2. High-Quality Content Is Locked Behind Paywalls\n\nGreat journalism, research, insights \u2014 sab kuch paywall ke peeche.\nBut log ek article ke liye pura subscription nahi lena chahte.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Users drop off, creators lose potential revenue.\n\n3. Too Many Platforms, Too Many Subscriptions\n\nEvery app/news portal wants its own subscription.\nMonthly expenses stack up, users get frustrated.\n\u27a1\ufe0f \u201cSubscription fatigue\u201d is real.\n\n4. Creators Don\u2019t Get Fair Payment\n\nPlatforms earn fixed subscription revenue,\nbut creators get almost nothing unless the reader subscribes to the full app.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Content creators are undervalued.\n\n5. No Transparency in Content Value\n\nReaders don't know if the content is worth paying for until after buying a subscription.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Trust breaks, user churn increases.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges I Ran Into (and How I Solved Them)\n1. Paywall Bypassing Risk\n\nChallenge:\nWhen I first built the pay-per-article flow, I realized users could potentially access the article through direct URLs, bypassing the paywall screen.\n\nSolution:\nI restructured the backend authorization \u2014 every article request now passes through a token-based check. Only paid users get a temporary access token, and even bookmarked links expire after a defined time.\nThis made the paywall genuinely secure.\n\n2. Micro-Payments Integration\n\nChallenge:\nMost payment gateways are optimized for full transactions (like \u20b950\u2013\u20b9100), not \u20b91\u2013\u20b95 micro-payments. Transactions were failing or taking too long.\n\nSolution:\nI implemented a wallet system inside the app where users preload a small amount, and individual article unlocks deduct instantly without hitting the gateway each time.\nThis fixed delays and reduced gateway fees dramatically.\n\n3. Content Rendering Optimization\n\nChallenge:\nLong articles were rendering slowly on low-end phones because the layout loaded everything at once.\n\nSolution:\nI added lazy loading for images, optimized text blocks, and cached the most-read articles.\nThis made the reading experience smooth and instant.\n\n4. Creator Dashboard Confusion\n\nChallenge:\nCreators found it difficult to understand their earnings dashboard \u2014 especially per-article breakdowns.\n\nSolution:\nI redesigned the UI with a simple structure:\n\ntotal reads\n\nearnings per article\n\nmonthly payout timeline\n\ntrending content indicators\nThe clarity increased creator retention.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nUse Cases: What can people use it for?\n\"Guest Checkout\" for Everything: Users can order food (Zomato), book hotels (Booking.com), or buy tickets (Ticketmaster) without creating accounts or logging into those specific websites. The Agent handles the login and checkout; the user simply approves the payment.\n\nSubscription Management Proxy: Instead of giving a real credit card to a risky new SaaS tool or news site, the user pays their Agent via x402. The Agent generates a virtual card with a strict limit (e.g., exactly $10/month) to pay the service. If the user wants to cancel, they just stop paying the Agent\u2014no need to navigate complex \"unsubscribe\" flows.\n\nCross-Border Commerce: A user with USDC on Base in India or Nigeria can instantly pay for services in the US or Europe that only accept Visa/Mastercard, without needing a local bank account or international credit card.\n\nMicro-Consulting & Gated Access: Experts or creators can gate specific answers or content behind a 402 paywall. An AI agent can automatically pay these micro-fees (e.g., $0.05 per query) to access premium data sources or expert models in real-time.\n\nHow it makes existing tasks Easier & Safer\n1. Safer: The \"Financial Firewall\"\n\nPrivacy Preservation: Users never expose their personal credit card details, home address, or phone number to random vendors. The AI Agent acts as a proxy, using disposable virtual cards and masked contact info.\n\nHack-Proof Payments: Since every transaction uses a unique, one-time-use virtual card generated by the Agent, a data breach at a vendor (like a hotel chain or retailer) cannot compromise the user's main funds.\n\n2. Easier: The \"Universal Interface\"\n\nEliminating UI Fatigue: Instead of learning the interface for 50 different apps (Uber, DoorDash, Airbnb, etc.), the user learns just one interface: the chat. The Agent handles the complexity of the underlying websites via MCP.\n\nZero-Friction Crypto Spending: Currently, spending crypto requires off-ramping to a bank, waiting days, and using a debit card. This solution makes spending USDC on Base as fast as sending a text message, unlocking the real purchasing power of on-chain assets.\n\nAutomated Logistics: The Agent doesn't just pay; it handles the \"boring\" work. It can compare prices across 10 sites in seconds, fill out the forms, and apply coupon codes automatically before presenting the final \"Pay\" button to the user.",

You over-convert, wait, and often end up with unused fiat sitting idle in a bank account.\n\n\nHow x402 Fixes This\n\nx402 enables a pay-per-request payment model.\n\nInstead of converting \u20b910,000 upfront and hoping you\u2019ll use it all, you pay exactly what you need, exactly when you need it.\n\t\u2022\tPaying \u20b9100 for chai? \u2192 One request, one signature\n\t\u2022\tSending \u20b95,000 to a friend? \u2192 Same flow\n\t\u2022\tNo pre-conversion, no waiting, no batching\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\t1.\tThe backend responds with HTTP 402 Payment Required\n\t2.\tThat response specifies exactly how much USDC is needed\n\t3.\tYou sign once with MetaMask\n\t4.\tThe x402 facilitator settles the payment on-chain\n\t5.\tThe receiver instantly gets INR to their UPI ID\n\nEvery payment is:\n\t\u2022\tOn-chain verified\n\t\u2022\tNon-custodial\n\t\u2022\tTied to a single API request\n\n\nBuckets, Pools & Liquidity Providers (INR Side)\n\nTo make instant INR payouts possible, x402-Pay uses a bucket-based liquidity system.\n\t\u2022\tLiquidity providers deposit INR into configurable buckets\n\t\u2022\tEach bucket defines:\n\t\u2022\tExchange rate\n\t\u2022\tMin / max transaction size\n\t\u2022\tRisk and availability parameters\n\t\u2022\tWhen a payment request comes in, buckets compete in real time\n\t\u2022\tA Dutch-auction style matching engine selects the best combination of buckets\n\nKey Point:\n\n- Anyone can become a liquidity provider.\n\nIf your bucket offers:\n\t\u2022\tBetter rates\n\t\u2022\tReliable availability\n\t\u2022\tHealthy liquidity\nit gets selected more often, and earns more USDC.\n\nThis creates a permissionless, market-driven FX layer where:\n\t\u2022\tNo single entity controls pricing\n\t\u2022\tCompetition drives better rates\n\t\u2022\tCapital efficiency improves for both users and LPs\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Crypto Adoption in India\n\nThis is what finally makes stablecoins usable in India.\n\nToday, holding USDC means very little if you can\u2019t spend it.\nx402-Pay turns stablecoins into real money for daily life.\n\t\u2022\tPay anyone with a UPI ID\n\t\u2022\tNo onboarding required for receivers\n\t\u2022\tNo pre-conversion\n\t\u2022\tNo idle fiat\n\nThat\u2019s 300+ million UPI users instantly reachable from a crypto wallet.\n\nx402\u2019s pay-per-request model is perfect for daily payments:\n\t\u2022\tYou don\u2019t batch-convert and hope\n\t\u2022\tYou pay as you go\n\t\u2022\tEvery transaction is verifiable on-chain\n\nStablecoins finally become liquid, spendable, and useful.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nFirst time hearing about x402 didn't even know HTTP 402 was a real status code.\n\nThe main challenge was implementing dynamic pricing. Most x402 examples use fixed prices, but our app needs different amounts for each payment. Had to build custom middleware that fetches the quote and returns that exact USDC amount as the x402 price.\n\nAlso hit some nasty build issues with WalletConnect + Next.js 16. Packages were bundling test files and breaking the build. Fixed it by switching to webpack and adding aliases to force consistent package versions.\n\nThe \"sign, don't send\" paradigm took a bit to understand, users sign EIP-712 messages and the facilitator does the actual transfer. Once it clicked, I realized how clean this model is for payments.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**DAO governance is fundamentally broken**. It's defined by *operational paralysis* and *token plutocracy*, forcing the best founders into a false choice: stay centralized to move fast, or decentralize and become irrelevant. This isn't a theoretical problem. When major DAOs like ApeCoin, with a multi-billion dollar treasury, vote to kill their own decentralization, it reveals a deep architectural failure in the current ecosystem.\n\nFirst-generation tools like Snapshot and Tally solved vote aggregation, but they don't address the root cause. They are the infrastructure for \"governance theater,\" not high-velocity operations.\n\ngovAIrn is a two-sided intelligence platform that re-architects how DAOs operate. We provide the infrastructure for the next generation of DAO tooling, focused on turning raw data into operational velocity.\n\nOur platform is built on a core innovation: the Influence Score. It's our AI engine that moves beyond simple token-voting to analyze and quantify all forms of value creation\u2014from on-chain activity and GitHub commits to social mindshare on platforms like X and Farcaster.\n\nThis engine powers our two-sided B2B2C platform:\n\n- **For DAOs (The Command Center)**: We provide an operational toolkit for leaders to get real-time visibility into governance health, use predictive analytics to forecast proposal outcomes, safely delegate tasks using a tiered system, and design merit-based reward programs. This solves the problem of governance paralysis, giving leaders the confidence to decentralize securely.\n- **For Contributors (The AI Co-Pilot)**: We provide tools for members to cut through the noise, understand complex proposals with AI-powered summaries, and build a verifiable on-chain reputation for their work. This solves token plutocracy by giving a voice and tangible rewards to real builders, not just the biggest wallets.\n\nBy creating a **symbiotic loop** between DAO operators and their contributors, govAIrn builds a defensible data flywheel. More efficient DAOs attract better contributors, whose engagement generates a rich governance dataset, making our AI smarter and accelerating our lead. We aren't just building another tool; we are building the essential **operational and reputation layer for the on-chain economy**.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Unified DAO Ecosystem Integration**\nOne of my biggest challenges was creating a standardized interface across diverse DAOs (Uniswap, ENS, Aave, Gitcoin, StakeDAO). Each uses different data structures and governance mechanisms. I built a proposal processing service that normalizes varying timestamp formats and metadata schemas with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent functionality.\n\n**AgentKit & Delegation Implementation**\nIntegrating AgentKit required solving several complex problems: creating secure agent identities, managing delegation of voting power, and establishing secure communication between AI decisions and on-chain execution. The delegation system needed to handle partial delegation percentages while maintaining user sovereignty. I designed a multi-layered architecture with strict separation between user and agent wallets, custom wallet generation, and secure transaction queue management.\n\n**Database & Security Architecture**\nThe Supabase implementation presented challenges with row-level security policies, particularly when seeding data and performing background syncs. I implemented edge functions for critical operations that needed to bypass RLS, designed permission hierarchies based on user roles, and created a custom database structure that supported complex querying patterns for proposal aggregation.\n\n**Proposal Synchronization & Processing**\nMaintaining real-time proposal data across multiple DAOs required addressing rate limiting, efficient handling of active and closed proposals, and proper timestamp normalization. I limited syncing to the 10 most recent proposals per DAO, implemented caching mechanisms, and created a custom sorting system to ensure proposals displayed correctly by end date, which was critical for user experience.\n\n**Transparent AI Decision Framework**\nBuilding a transparent AI governance system required exposing decision-making processes without overwhelming users. I developed a specialized prompt engineering system that creates deterministic reasoning frameworks, extracts key points from proposals, and aligns outputs with user preferences. The architecture records every step of the AI's chain-of-thought reasoning and creates verifiable links between preferences, decisions, and on-chain actions.\n\n**Performance & User Experience**\nThe UI needed to handle real-time updates from multiple data sources while maintaining responsiveness. I implemented optimized rendering patterns, strategic data prefetching, and targeted component updates to create a smooth experience even when processing complex proposal data or generating AI decisions.\nThese solutions resulted in a governance platform that successfully bridges the gap between complex on-chain operations and an accessible interface for DAO participation on Base.\n\n-- \n\nUPDATED\n\nBuilding a two-sided intelligence platform that re-architects DAO governance from the ground up presented a unique set of technical and strategic challenges.\n\nMulti-Source Data Ingestion & Normalization:\nThe core of our Influence Score required ingesting and unifying wildly different datasets: on-chain voting records, unstructured GitHub commit data, and real-time social media signals from APIs like Farcaster and X. Creating a standardized data pipeline that could normalize this information, handle varying schemas, and process it into a single, coherent input for our AI engine was a major architectural hurdle.\n\nDesigning a Sybil-Resistant Influence Algorithm:\nThe credibility of our platform rests on the integrity of the Influence Score. A key challenge was designing the initial algorithmic weighting and AI models to be resilient against manipulation. I had to develop systems to detect and penalize low-quality contributions, such as spammy GitHub commits or inauthentic social engagement from bot farms, ensuring that the score reflects genuine, verifiable merit.\n\nArchitecting a Real-Time Two-Sided UI:\nBuilding a UI that effectively serves two distinct user personas\u2014strategic DAO operators and individual contributors\u2014from the same backend was a significant UX and engineering challenge. The DAO Command Center needed to present high-level analytics and complex configuration tools, while the Contributor Co-Pilot required a more personalized, task-oriented interface. Engineering a performant system that could serve both UIs with real-time data without lag was critical.\n\nBootstrapping the Predictive Analytics Engine:\nOur goal of providing predictive insights on proposal outcomes required a robust machine learning model. The initial challenge was training this model with a limited and often noisy set of historical governance data. I had to implement sophisticated feature engineering to extract meaningful signals from past proposals and build a system that could learn and improve as our platform ingested more data from new DAOs.\n\nSecure & Scalable Backend for Cross-DAO Operations:\nThe platform needed a backend that was not only scal",

Before this people had a fear of losing their data to the companies which organize these bets in open like Dream11 on sports, Rummy Circle etc. but here we used zkProofs to compare the results and verify it without leaking the data on chain.\nThis helps people to get a sense of security in case they lose too. Overall it elevates the betting game.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOK!! So we had a hell lot of problems while making it working:\n1. We firstly encounter the problem of generating the proof and then connecting it to the frontend, we didn't think it to be that hard, but after rigorous tries and fails, we finally did something which got it working for a reason, and there's a saying that don't disturb if it works.\n2. Second problem came when we tried to attach API calls with the zk, it seemed very easy but was not, unfortunately we were unable to gather apis from the big game companies like Valorant. so we decided to stick on COC, whose was available for free.\n3. We could not deploy it on vercel or any other website, maybe due to its complex nature, or one pain in tooth thing , that the API for COC was IP Address specific, so it was not possible  for us to  deploy it on vercel because we didn't have their IP Address and then API fetches were not made properly. So that  was it, we tried it on some static address providers but they didn't fit for our project type , all of them wanted some mobile app kinda things, so we are still stuck the demo video is shot on localhost sadly, we will try our best in future to fix it.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am participating in Based India to showcase how blockchain technology can transform financial systems, especially in developing economies like India. The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has immense potential to improve financial inclusivity, but the current overcollateralization requirements in DeFi loans limit accessibility for smaller players. Through my project, Decentralized Credit Scoring System (DCS), I aim to tackle this issue by enabling undercollateralized loans, which could be a game-changer for underserved communities.\n\nBeing from Delhi-NCR, I have a strong connection to the region and have seen firsthand the challenges many people face in accessing fair financial services. DeFi provides an opportunity to offer more transparent, accessible, and decentralized financial tools. Base\u2019s low-cost, scalable infrastructure makes it ideal for running applications like DCS that need secure and efficient handling of on-chain data.\n\nParticipating in Based India is a chance to highlight how my project can help bridge the gap between Web3 technologies and real-world financial problems. I\u2019m excited to connect with a community that is passionate about building decentralized solutions for India\u2019s growing blockchain ecosystem, and Base offers the perfect platform for this innovation.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nIn the traditional financial system, one of the biggest challenges for people, especially in developing countries like India, is access to fair credit. Many individuals don\u2019t have the collateral or credit history required to secure loans from traditional financial institutions. This limits their ability to invest in their businesses, education, or personal development. Even in the DeFi space, access to loans is often restricted to those who can overcollateralize.\n\nI\u2019m focusing on solving this problem by creating a Decentralized Credit Scoring System (DCS) that offers under-collateralized loans based on transparent, verifiable on-chain credit scores. With Base\u2019s efficient, scalable infrastructure, DCS can calculate credit scores based on a user\u2019s history of borrowing and repayment across DeFi protocols, ensuring fairer access to loans.\n\nThe challenge I\u2019m addressing is financial inclusivity. By utilizing blockchain technology and decentralization, DCS offers a way to bypass the need for a trusted central authority or a traditional credit history. This solution is particularly valuable for unbanked or underbanked individuals who don\u2019t have access to the traditional credit system. Base allows for cost-effective deployment of smart contracts, making this solution scalable to large populations.\n\nWith India\u2019s growing adoption of Web3 technologies, DCS can have a significant impact on providing fair, accessible financial services, empowering communities to leverage blockchain for financial growth.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nThe Decentralized Credit Scoring System (DCS) aims to solve the problem of overcollateralized loans in DeFi by introducing on-chain credit scores that allow users to access under-collateralized loans. This project leverages the Base to offer scalable, secure, and low-cost smart contracts for calculating a user\u2019s credit score based on their lending and borrowing history.\n\nThe core of DCS is a smart contract system deployed on Base, which calculates credit scores based on factors like repayment history, loan-to-collateral ratio, and borrowing frequency. These scores enable users to borrow without requiring excessive collateral, making DeFi lending more accessible, particularly to unbanked or underbanked populations. This addresses the problem of capital inefficiency and opens up the DeFi ecosystem to more users who would otherwise be excluded.\n\nThe potential impact of DCS is significant. By reducing collateral requirements, the system allows smaller users to access loans, thereby promoting financial inclusion. The use of a Decentralized Identity (DID) linked to credit scores ensures that users can carry their financial reputation across multiple DeFi platforms. Additionally, the transparency and security of blockchain ensure that credit scores are verifiable and immune to tampering.\n\nBy being built on Base, DCS benefits from lower transaction costs and scalability, making it an ideal solution for large-scale adoption in regions like India, where financial access is a critical issue.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### Real-Time On-Chain Data Fetching\nAnother challenge was fetching real-time on-chain data to calculate credit scores. I initially attempted to use decentralized oracles, but due to costs, I manually integrated APIs from platforms like Aave. This solution worked for the hackathon, but in future versions, I plan to automate this process using oracles.\n\n### Non-Technical Challenge: User Adoption\nThe biggest non-technical challenge was ensuring that potential users, especially those unfamiliar with DeFi, understood how the platform worked and the benefits of on-chain credit scoring. To address this, I created a simple, intuitive UI using React and Next.js, with easy-to-use dashboards for borrowers and lenders, making DeFi loans accessible even for non-technical users.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nWhile I haven\u2019t implemented the Compound API yet, I laid the groundwork for its integration to further enhance the platform\u2019s credit scoring by pulling data from multiple DeFi platforms.",

By participating in initiatives like Based India, I aim to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations to create impactful solutions that address local needs while fostering sustainable development.\nAdditionally, I am excited about the vibrant startup ecosystem in India, which is rapidly evolving and attracting global attention. I want to be part of this movement, contributing my expertise to help build innovative products and services that can make a difference in people's lives. My goal is to support the growth of a tech-savvy workforce and promote knowledge sharing, ultimately driving economic growth and social change in the region\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nI am focusing on several key challenges in my community with the help of Base:\n1. Access to Opportunities: Many talented individuals in my community lack access to platforms where they can showcase their skills and connect with potential clients or collaborators. By leveraging Base, I aim to create a decentralized skill exchange platform that empowers users to offer and find services easily.\n2. Skill Development: There is a significant gap in skill development and training resources. I plan to facilitate workshops and training sessions through the platform, enabling users to enhance their skills and adapt to the evolving job market.\n3. Trust and Transparency: In many traditional service exchanges, trust is a major concern. By utilizing blockchain technology, I aim to ensure transparency in transactions and build a reputation system that fosters trust among users.\n4. Economic Empowerment: Many individuals in my community are looking for ways to supplement their income. The skill exchange platform will provide them with opportunities to monetize their skills, thereby contributing to their economic empowerment.\n5. Community Building: I want to foster a sense of community among users, encouraging collaboration and networking. By creating a space where individuals can connect, share knowledge, and support each other, we can strengthen our local ecosystem\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges I Ran Into\n1. Wallet Connection Issues\nOne of the primary hurdles was ensuring a seamless wallet connection experience for users. Initially, users faced difficulties connecting their MetaMask wallets, often due to browser compatibility issues or not having the MetaMask extension installed.\nSolution: I implemented comprehensive error handling and user feedback through snackbars to inform users about the connection status. Additionally, I provided clear instructions on installing MetaMask and troubleshooting common issues.\n2. Smart Contract Interaction\nInteracting with the smart contracts posed challenges, especially when fetching user skills and handling transactions. I encountered issues with incorrect contract addresses and ABI mismatches, which led to failed transactions and errors.\nSolution: I meticulously verified the contract addresses and ensured that the ABI files were correctly imported. I also added console logs to track the flow of data and identify where issues occurred, which helped in debugging.\n3. State Management\nManaging the state of user skills and service requests was complex, particularly when updating the UI after transactions. I faced issues where the UI did not reflect the latest data after a skill was listed or a service request was created.\nSolution: I implemented a more structured approach to state management by using React's useEffect hooks to fetch updated data after each transaction. This ensured that the UI was always in sync with the blockchain state.\n4. User Experience Design\nDesigning an intuitive user interface that effectively communicated the process of skill exchange was a challenge. Users were sometimes confused about how to navigate the platform and utilize its features.\nSolution: I conducted user testing sessions to gather feedback on the UI/UX. Based on the feedback, I made adjustments to the layout, added tooltips, and improved the overall design to enhance usability.\n5. Deployment and Environment Configuration",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nAlthough I may not be based in India, my participation reflects my appreciation for India's rapidly growing tech ecosystem and its vibrant blockchain community. India has emerged as a major hub for blockchain innovation, with increasing adoption and experimentation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3. This project aligns with India's vision for transparency, financial inclusion, and trustless systems, and I believe it can contribute to empowering communities and developers within the region.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nThe key challenge we\u2019re addressing is the lack of trust in traditional lotteries and gambling systems. In many communities, particularly those with limited access to transparent financial services, people often face challenges of fraud, opaque operations, and centralization in lottery systems.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur decentralized lottery system leverages the Base blockchain to create a fair, tamper-proof system where no central authority controls the lottery outcome. All transactions, entries, and winners are publicly verifiable on the blockchain, which fosters trust and transparency. The smart contract automates the process, ensuring that the prize pool is distributed without any manual intervention. By providing an open, permissionless lottery system, we enable individuals from any community to participate in a fair and secure game.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the main challenges was integrating the randomness generation for selecting the lottery winner. Generating random numbers in a decentralized environment is non-trivial because on-chain randomness can be manipulated by miners or validators. We overcame this by combining blockchain parameters like block difficulty and timestamp in the smart contract to create a pseudo-random number. For a more secure approach, we considered using Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for true randomness, but it required additional integration.\nOn the frontend, the main challenge was managing the MetaMask connection to interact with the Base testnet. I worked through this by implementing Ethers.js to handle contract interactions effectively and ensuring seamless MetaMask integration."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI am participating in Based India to connect with a community of like-minded developers and innovators who are passionate about building decentralized solutions. My interest in blockchain technology aligns with the spirit of the hackathon, and I see this as an opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to the vibrant tech community in the region. Being a part of this hackathon allows me to explore how blockchain can be applied to education and create value through technology.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nOne of the key challenges I am addressing is making learning and testing knowledge more engaging and rewarding for users. Traditional quiz apps don\u2019t provide any tangible rewards, which can reduce user motivation. By leveraging blockchain, I aim to create a system where users have a financial stake in their quizzes, thus making learning more interactive and incentivized. Additionally, I want to address the lack of transparency in online quiz reward systems by ensuring users can trust the process through decentralized transactions.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nMy project, Quizzy, transforms the quiz experience by introducing a financial incentive using blockchain. Users pay a small fee in Aptos tokens to take a quiz. If they perform well, their payment is refunded, offering a tangible reward for their effort. This mechanism not only motivates users to engage more deeply with the quizzes but also introduces a sense of fairness and transparency. By utilizing smart contracts, users can be assured that the reward process is automated and tamper-proof, fostering trust and engagement in the learning process.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne technical challenge I faced was integrating Aptos payments into a user-friendly mobile experience. The process involved setting up smart contracts in the Move language, connecting with the Pontem wallet, and ensuring secure transactions. Another challenge was creating a fair refund system that executes based on quiz scores, which required precise logic in smart contracts. I overcame these by thoroughly researching Aptos documentation, testing the contract logic on Remix, and leveraging the Kaptos SDK to streamline the user-wallet interaction on Android.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nDuring the Buildathon, I focused on refining the UI/UX to make the app more intuitive for users, ensuring smooth navigation from payment to quiz completion. I also implemented the \u2018Connect to Wallet\u2019 feature, allowing users to seamlessly integrate their Pontem wallet into the app for a better user experience. Additionally, I optimized the smart contracts for better efficiency and added detailed error handling to improve the reliability of transactions.",

There\u2019s no scoreboard for conviction.\n\n> Prediction markets are too rigid.\n> Fantasy games are too abstract.\n> Betting apps are too shallow.\n> None of them let you monetize conviction at the speed of internet discourse.\n\nFlashDuels turns any narrative into a high-stakes, tradable market - instantly.\nIt gives users the tools to create, trade, and resolve markets on trending debates, events, or ideas without needing technical knowledge or waiting for centralized platforms to list them.\n\n**Unique insights**\n1. People want to express belief, not just predict outcomes. They\u2019re not analysts and they want a scoreboard.\n2. Fun > accuracy. Like fantasy sports or meme coins, people play to win social capital, not just money.\n3. Markets don\u2019t have to be rational. They just have to be real-time. FlashDuels embraces narrative volatility, and creating natural market discovery for the most favourable outcome.\n4. The next breakout in consumer crypto won\u2019t look like finance. It\u2019ll look like a game, a groupchat, or a social feed - crypto is the only possible way to fuel this new user behaviour.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. FlashDuels draws from prediction markets, fantasy, meme trading, and InfoFi, yet belongs to none. Differentiating required building not just features, but a new narrative category. Inspired by Paradigm\u2019s Multiverse thesis, we adopted a laddered rollout to guide users into this new behavior - starting with duels, expanding to leagues, then seasonal token economies.\n\n2. Fair Resolution: Built an off-chain resolver using oracle data to settle 60-min duels instantly. But as the markets scale will need verifiable method such as ZKTLS.\n\n3. Liquidity Without Order Books: Designed a Peer-to-peer model that scales volume without fragmenting liquidity.\n\n4. Preventing Sybil Abuse: Added a bonding curve, min bets, creation fees, and creator stakes to keep bots out and skin-in-the-game real.\n\n5. UX for GenZ (particularly non-crypto users): Rebuilt the interface from scratch to feel like a tinder app on mobile - quick swipe left or right.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Base PingPong Arena** addresses a significant gap in the blockchain gaming ecosystem: the lack of engaging, onchain-first **multiplayer** games that are both fun and accessible while also showcasing the power of decentralized infrastructure.\n\nMost blockchain games today suffer from high entry barriers, clunky interfaces, or overly financialized mechanics that limit real player enjoyment. Our project flips this narrative by offering a fast-paced, competitive **1v1** ping pong game where every match, move, and reward is **fully onchain**\u2014making gameplay provably fair, transparent, and immutable.\n\nThis project provides:\n\t\u2022\tTrustless Game Mechanics: Using smart contracts, players **stake ETH**, compete in skill-based matches, and automatically receive rewards\u2014all without intermediaries.\n\t\u2022\tNFT-Based Progression: Players mint and upgrade unique NFT paddles based on their win history, creating lasting digital assets with real gameplay utility.\n\t\u2022\tBuilt-In Marketplace: Our onchain **NFT marketplace** allows players to buy, sell, and trade upgraded assets directly on Base.\n\t\u2022\tOnchain Leaderboards: Transparent ranking and match logs increase replayability, encouraging competition and community growth.\n\t\u2022\tTrue Ownership & Interoperability: All player assets and stats are owned by users and **verifiable** on the **Base chain**, enabling future integration with other ecosystems.\n\nBy combining addictive gameplay with robust onchain infrastructure, Base PingPong Arena redefines what blockchain gaming can be\u2014simple, skill-based, and radically transparent.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding **Base PingPong Arena** was a rewarding challenge! One of the first obstacles I faced was getting the smart contracts fully deployed and functional on the Base mainnet. Since I didn\u2019t initially have Base ETH, I couldn\u2019t test or deploy anything\u2014until the amazing Base Batch team on Discord stepped in to help me out with ETH and guidance. That support kept the momentum going.\n\nFrom there, it was all about pushing the limits of onchain gameplay. I built an entire matchmaking system, **ETH staking logic**, and auto-battle resolution into the smart contract. Making all of that run fairly and securely onchain wasn\u2019t easy, but it was exciting.\n\nThen came the NFTs\u2014each player mints and upgrades unique PingPong characters based on wins. Storing that kind of dynamic data onchain while keeping it gas-efficient was a tough nut to crack, but I handled it by encoding metadata directly inside the contract.\n\nFinally, **integrating** an NFT marketplace and making sure the frontend synced smoothly with all onchain events was the last major hurdle. I used ethers.js to connect everything in real time and give users a clean, interactive experience.\n\nEvery challenge helped make the project more solid and fun to play\u2014and now it\u2019s fully live and playable on Base!",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# _At\u200b\u200d\u200b\u200c\u200d\u200b\u200d\u200c the moment_\n**AI agents** are like lonely geniuses locked up in solitary confinement. Although they have massive processing power, they are practically powerless in the market. If an autonomous agent wants to use an external tool, for example, a specialized image generator or a premium market data feed, it just cannot do that. The agent can only make up a request or error out until a human physically inserts a credit card, creates an API key, and hardcodes it into a ***.env*** file.\n\n**ASAP** *(Agent Service Discovery & Attestation Protocol)* fixes the \"**Agent Cold Start**\" issue. It converts agents from isolated chatbots into autonomous economic actors.\n\nThis protocol which I have constructed is supposed to be **two essential layers** of infrastructure for the machine economy:\n\n- **The \"Yellow Pages\" (Discovery)**: A decentralized, on-chain registry where agents can programmatically search for services based on *capabilities* and *trust* (via Farcaster attestations), instead of depending on *static*, *human-curated lists* or *centralized DNS*.\n\n- **The \"Visa Network\" (Settlement)**: A real-world usage of the long-dormant ***HTTP 402 (Payment Required)*** standard. It permits agents to perform *negotiations* and *settle payments for API access* instantly and on a *per-request basis*, without human intervention.\n\n# **Real-World Utility:**\n\n- **Autonomous Supply Chains:** A \"*Manager Agent*\" is able to on the fly recruit a \"*Coder Agent*\" and a \"*Designer Agent*\" from the registry, pay them in ***$ASAP tokens***, and complete a product without the user having accounts on three different SaaS platforms. \n\n- **DePIN Monetization:** Those who have powerful local hardware (e.g., *a gaming PC running Llama-3*) can turn their *IP into an endpoint*. Agents everywhere can find this endpoint and *pay micro-transactions* to execute inference tasks, thus allowing the compute access to be democratized.\n\n- **Permissionless Access:** In contrast to *OAuth* or *Stripe*, which need *KYC* and *passports*, ASAP permits any script with a private key to take part in the economy.\n\nTo sum it up, I have set up the infrastructure whereby a **Python script**(*An Autonomous Bot*) can employ a **Netlify function**(*Endpoint*) and pay for it with ***Crypto($ASAP Tokens)***, all without human \u200b\u200d\u200b\u200c\u200d\u200b\u200d\u200cintervention.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIt's\u200b\u200d\u200b\u200c\u200d\u200b\u200d\u200c almost never about just writing the *happy path* when one wants to build *decentralized infrastructure*; rather, it is about dealing with the mess that comes from *chaos of distributed systems*. Here are the **obstacles** in detail that I managed to overcome:\n\n1. ***The \"Free Tier\" RPC Bottleneck*:** In the very beginning, I conceived the **Indexer** to be the normal enterprise service kind of the Indexer\u2014meaning that it would carry out the **entire blockchain history** at startup so the database could be built locally. *Public RPC nodes,* of course, were the first to limit the rate of my requests when I tried to fetch data for *100,000 blocks in one go*. The indexing logic thus had to be re-architected by me in order to implement a \"***chunking***\" method that breaks block ranges into *digestible 2,000-block segments* with *exponential backoff*. It is a **less aggressive method**, but it is what keeps the indexer stable on **free-tier infrastructure**.\n\n2. ***The \"Unknown Agent\" Race Condition*:** To *save gas* on Base Sepolia, I made the smart contracts *more efficient* so that they would emit only the *minimal data* in events (**IDs and pointers**). Nonetheless, this led to a race condition in the frontend whereby the UI would render \"***Unknown Agent***\" as the event log did not have the human-readable name. The Indexer was rewritten by me to be a \"Smart Poller\"\u2014it now gets the event, makes a ***secondary readContract call*** to get the ***full JSON metadata*** from the chain, and after verification, it commits to the ***local SQLite database***. The frontend communicates with the Indexer only, thus partial state is never shown.\n\n3. ***Reactivity vs. Blockchain Latency*:** The hit of humility that comes from seeing a user clicking on \"***Pay***,\" viewing the transaction confirmation on the blockchain, and on seeing the UI balance not changing and still showing 0 can hardly be matched by anything else. The very cause of the UI confusion was that the disconnect between the blockchain's \"**confirmed**\" state and the *RPC node's \"indexed\" state* was leading to the **UI showing old data**. I addressed this issue by the introduction of an ***aggressive cache invalidation strategy*** with the use of ***TanStack Query***. I set a **refetchInterval** on the wallet balance and a manual invalidation was triggered *1.5 seconds* after transaction receipt\u2014a \"*network buffer*\" that was absolutely necessary for the delay in the propagation of the testnet.\n\n4. ***The snake_case Python Migration:*:** While working on the autonomous Python bot, a moment came when the *script kept crashing during transaction signing*, and I couldn't figure out why. The reason being, I was following the web3.py v5 guide for the docs, but the environment had v6 installed, which changed the naming convention from camelCase to snake_case for nearly all attributes (e.g., ***rawTransaction*** became ***raw_transaction***). It was a **small syntax mistake** that was pointing to a *major cryptographic failure* and as a result, it taught me the lesson that I should always pin my dependencies.\n\n5. ***Simulation vs. Reality:*:** My first frontend demo was just \"***spoofing***\" the ***402 error*** to demonstrate how it would look. I wasn't satisfied with that. At the hackathon's midpoint, I decided to go in a completely different direction and actually create a ***serverless Oracle*** on Netlify that ***verifies transaction hashes*** on-chain. To connect the frontend to this real endpoint, the ***TestAgentModal*** had to be rewritten so that it could dynamically deal with the **real HTTP 402** responses, getting the payment details by *parsing the JSON body* rather than from the *hardcoding*. The end result is a frontend that does a *cryptographic handshake for real*, not just a *UI \u200b\u200d\u200b\u200c\u200d\u200b\u200d\u200canimation*.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nI\u2019m participating in Based India because I see it as an opportunity to bring our project attn.bio to life in a way that can create meaningful connections between people. attn.bio enables users to send a message to notable individuals with a monetary commitment, providing a platform for valuable interactions that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be accessible. This hackathon is an ideal space to explore innovative solutions, collaborate with brilliant minds, and receive feedback on how to further refine the project, while contributing to the broader community with a product that promotes engagement and value exchange\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe\u2019re focusing on the challenge of enabling meaningful communication between individuals and notable figures who are often inaccessible. In today\u2019s world, reaching out to someone influential can be daunting and often ignored. attn.bio aims to solve this by creating a platform where users can attach a monetary commitment to their message, incentivizing a response and adding value to both sides\n\nWith the help of Base, we\u2019re addressing the challenge of creating more equitable access to valuable conversations and connections. Many people struggle to have their voices heard or access opportunities that could help them grow. attn.bio tackles this issue by empowering users with a mechanism to reach out to key individuals, while those receiving the messages can benefit financially or donate to causes they support. This creates a more balanced and rewarding exchange of ideas in the community.\u201d\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur submission, attn.bio, directly addresses the challenge by creating a platform where users can send messages to notable individuals, accompanied by a monetary commitment stored in a smart contract. This financial incentive encourages a response, bridging the gap between people who seek valuable conversations and those who are often difficult to reach. By utilizing blockchain technology, the process is transparent, secure, and efficient, ensuring that both parties benefit from the exchange. Additionally, attn.bio fosters meaningful connections, where the funds can be directed towards personal causes or charitable donations, further enhancing the impact of each interaction\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the key hurdles we encountered was dealing with Twitter API rate limits, which restrict us to interacting with only 3 users per 15 minutes. This limitation posed a significant challenge in scaling our platform for real-time messaging and interactions with multiple notable individuals."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nIn today's online world, fake reviews distort trust. Satyra Trips solves this by enabling users to verify their physical presence at a location before posting a review.\nBuilt on top of Satyra Protocol, Satyra Trips uses mock Proof of Presence to showcase how verified reviews can rebuild trust in travel platforms.\nUsers can search for restaurants, hotels, attractions, and post authentic reviews after a simple verification step, ensuring every review is linked to a real visit.\n\nThis app demonstrates how Satyra Protocol can power vertical applications in travel, food, commerce, and local discovery.\n\nKey Features:\n\nSearch and discover places\n\nMock \"Proof of Visit\" verification before reviewing\n\nWrite and publish reviews with \"Verified\" badges\n\nPublic view of verified reviews with timestamps and wallet IDs\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of Satyra Trips, one of the core challenges was architecting a seamless verification flow that could mimic real-world location proof in a lightweight MVP. Since access to actual GPS-based cryptographic proof or zero-knowledge location attestation was out of scope for the hackathon, we had to create a believable mock Proof-of-Visit system that still reflected the spirit of the protocol. Designing this system required balancing user experience with data integrity \u2014 ensuring that even with mock data, the demo captured how verifiable reviews could look in a real deployment.\n\nAnother obstacle was integrating dynamic browser interactions with Google Maps' DOM structure. Since we envisioned this as both a standalone mini-app and a future browser extension, identifying stable UI hooks within the Google Maps interface for future real-time detection was complex. We overcame this by modularizing our code and abstracting the verification flow to a component that could work both as a web-based mini-app and a browser extension integration.\n\nLastly, ensuring review data integrity even in a mock environment (without backend or smart contract support) pushed us to build a lightweight frontend-first data schema that could be extended later to include decentralized storage or on-chain attestation.",

Our project, \"zkVisa\" leverages smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to introduce a secure, decentralized mechanism for managing visa. By allowing immigrants to stake funds linked to a visa period and securely withdraw them only upon meeting verifiable time and location conditions, the system ensures compliance while preserving privacy. This not only reduces administrative overhead but also builds trust by making enforcement automated, auditable, and tamper-resistant.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the key challenges we faced was implementing zero-knowledge proofs for location data without compromising user privacy. To tackle this, we wrote custom circuits in Circom that validate a user's presence at a specific location without revealing the exact coordinates. Integrating these zk proofs with our smart contract required careful coordination to ensure accuracy.",

Early versions often produced buggy or incomplete results, which could discourage users. To overcome this, we built a \"prompt enhancement\" system that automatically upgrades simple user inputs into rich, detailed prompts optimized for better game generation. We also created a set of pre-tested templates to ensure new users always get a solid first experience.

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n[https://main.d318mfpii45gl0.amplifyapp.com/]\n**The Problem Medilocker Solves**\n\nMedilocker addresses several critical, interconnected problems prevalent in current healthcare data management:\n\n1.  **Fragmented and Siloed Medical Data:**\n    *   Patient medical records are often scattered across various healthcare providers, specialists, and facilities (e.g., GP, hospital, specialist clinic, pharmacy). Each system holds only a piece of the puzzle.\n    *   This makes it incredibly difficult for patients to access their complete medical history and for providers to get a holistic view of a patient's health.\n\n2.  **Lack of Patient Data Ownership and Control:**\n    *   Patients often have little to no direct control over who accesses their medical records, for how long, or for what purpose.\n    *   Accessing their own records can be a cumbersome, bureaucratic process.\n\n3.  **Inefficient and Slow Data Sharing for Providers:**\n    *   Transferring records between providers is often manual, slow, and prone to errors (e.g., faxing, mailing, incompatible digital systems).\n    *   This can lead to delays in treatment, redundant tests, and decisions made with incomplete information, potentially impacting patient outcomes.\n\n4.  **Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   Centralized databases are prime targets for data breaches, putting highly sensitive patient information at risk.\n    *   Ensuring data integrity (that records haven't been tampered with) can be challenging in traditional systems.\n\n5.  **High Administrative Overhead and Costs:**\n    *   Managing, retrieving, and sharing records manually or through disparate systems incurs significant administrative costs and staff time for healthcare providers.\n    *   Interoperability between different Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is often poor and expensive to implement.\n\n**How Medilocker Addresses These Needs or Improves Existing Solutions**\n\nMedilocker leverages blockchain technology (specifically Base L2) to offer significant improvements:\n\n1.  **Unifying Fragmented Data & Empowering Patients:**\n    *   **Addresses:** Fragmented data, lack of patient ownership.\n    *   **How:** Medilocker creates a **\"unified, patient-centered repository.\"** The blockchain acts as a secure, single source of truth that **\"follows individuals throughout their healthcare journey.\"**\n    *   **Improvement:** Instead of data being locked in provider silos, it's linked to the patient. Patients gain **\"true data ownership\"** and **\"cryptographic control,\"** allowing them to manage **\"granular permissions,\" \"temporary access,\"** and **\"revocable permissions.\"** This is a fundamental shift from provider-centric to patient-centric data control.\n\n2.  **Streamlining Provider Access & Reducing Overhead:**\n    *   **Addresses:** Inefficient data sharing, administrative burden.\n    *   **How:** Providers can get **\"instant, permissioned access to verified patient histories.\"** The platform aims for **\"universal provider connectivity\"** and **\"standardized data exchange,\"** simplifying record requests and enabling **\"real-time updates.\"**\n    *   **Improvement:** This dramatically reduces the time and effort needed to obtain patient records, leading to **\"more informed care decisions\"** and **\"reduced administrative overhead.\"** The **\"near-zero transaction costs\"** on Base L2 make frequent, small data accesses economically viable.\n\n3.  **Delivering Uncompromising Security & Privacy:**\n    *   **Addresses:** Security and privacy vulnerabilities.\n    *   **How:**\n        *   **\"Base L2 Blockchain Security\"** provides Ethereum-level, military-grade encryption.\n        *   **\"Immutable Audit Trails\"** mean every access or modification attempt is permanently recorded, ensuring data integrity and transparency.\n        *   **\"Zero-Knowledge Verification\"** allows data to be verified without exposing the sensitive underlying information.\n    *   **Improvement:** This offers a higher degree of security and transparency than many traditional centralized systems. Patients control access, and all actions are auditable, building trust and helping meet standards like **\"HIPAA, GDPR.\"**\n\n4.  **Offering a Cost-Effective, Scalable, and Interoperable Solution:**\n    *   **Addresses:** High costs, scalability issues, poor interoperability.\n    *   **How:**\n        *   **\"Near-Zero Transaction Costs\"** (up to 97% lower gas fees) make it affordable.\n        *   **\"Lightning-Fast Performance\"** and **\"high throughput capacity\"** ensure the system can handle millions of records efficiently and provide real-time access.\n        *   **\"Ethereum Ecosystem Compatibility\"** and **\"Easy API integration with existing EHR systems\"** promote interoperability.\n    *   **Improvement:** Traditional EHR integrations can be costly and complex. Medilocker's L2 approach provides a modern, efficient, and more economically sustainable model for secure data exchange, especially for features like micro-access permissions.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Challenges I Ran Into\n**1. Cross-Platform Data Compatibility**\nChallenge: Medical data is often stored in disparate formats across different hospital systems, making normalization a major hurdle.\nSolution: We implemented a standardized data exchange layer using HL7/FHIR adapters, which normalize incoming data and make it interoperable within the Medilocker ecosystem.\n\n**2. Onboarding Non-Technical Users**\nChallenge: Many users are not familiar with blockchain wallets or concepts like signing transactions and granting access via tokens.\nSolution: We integrated Coinbase OnchainKit for simplified wallet interaction and designed a user onboarding flow with tooltips, QR-based login, and a \u201cmock wallet\u201d for training/demo purposes.\n\n**3. Secure, Granular Access Control**\nChallenge: Implementing fine-grained, revocable access control for sensitive records without bloating the gas cost.\nSolution: Leveraged Base L2 for gas-efficient micro-permissions and implemented time-limited access tokens using a combination of smart contracts and off-chain access managers with cryptographic proof.\n\n**4. Decentralized Storage with Performance**\nChallenge: IPFS is great for decentralization but not optimized for speed when fetching large or time-sensitive data.\nSolution: We integrated IPFS with fallback local caching and pinning strategies to optimize for speed while maintaining decentralization.\n\n**5. Testing Across Multiple Packages**\nChallenge: Coordinating tests across a monorepo setup with contracts, frontend, and backend required extensive configuration.\nSolution: We modularized our test suites, used shared mocks, and adopted a CI setup to streamline testing across packages.\n\n**6. Sensitive Data Handling**\nChallenge: Verifying or sharing medical records without exposing sensitive information.\nSolution: Incorporated zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) frameworks to verify data attributes without revealing the data itself.\n\n**7. Smart Contract Deployment & Rollback**\nChallenge: Managing contract deployments on Base L2 with proper versioning and rollback capabilities during development.\nSolution: Used Hardhat Deploy with a detailed deployment script and contract state backup system for seamless redeployment and rollbacks.",

Our existing contracts on Base testnet motivate us to showcase our work, gather community feedback, and foster collaborations. With two team members from India, we're eager to contribute to and grow with India's thriving web3 ecosystem.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nCurrent blockchain analytics solutions are centralized and extractive, failing to fairly incentivize analyst contributions. Analysts often work for free or for just recognition, leading to burnout and decreased output as rewards diminish.\n\nThe only current alternative for web3 data analysts is to operate on a bounty system, where individuals or entities can request specific insights and dashboards for their projects or interests. A SQL \u201cwizard\u201d can then undertake this task, conducting the analysis on their behalf in exchange for a one-time payment. \n\nThis approach is reactive, as the analysis only takes place when specifically requested. We believe this leaves a significant gap in in-depth analysis that represents a lost opportunity for insights that could drive the whole industry forward.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nOur vision is to be the world's most analyst-centric tokenized platform for on-chain data intelligence.\nLeading Web3 analytics platforms are still working through a Web2 lens, and this is our massive opportunity.\n\nGlint is empowering crypto analysts with a low-code, AI-driven analytics platform that enables incredibly fast time-to-value and rewards their brilliance through a tokenized on-chain data intelligence economy, creating a world where knowledge flows, collaboration thrives, and value accrues within the community. \n\nDashboards created on Glint are minted as NFTs, with all interactions recorded through weighted voting. The interactions and votes determine the reward share Analysts get from the GLNT smart contract based on the value each dashboard provides to the community, as determined by the community themselves. We're calling this a create-to-earn model but are also working on features and ways to also incentivize content curators (Users, KOLs and Media Outlets). \n\nUltimately, we believe that a well design token economy can disrupt extractive, centralized businesses, and that ubiquitous, insightful dashboards have the power to accelerate innovation and illuminate the truth in decentralized ecosystems.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWe encountered challenges in effectively communicating our data schema to ChatGPT, which initially hindered our ability to obtain high-quality SQL code. To overcome this obstacle, we provided ChatGPT with more detailed information about our tables and implemented a strategic renaming of our columns. These changes were designed to reduce confusion and improve the AI's understanding of our data structure, ultimately leading to better SQL code generation.",

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nIndia is rapidly adopting blockchain technology, with a growing community of developers and entrepreneurs eager to solve real-world problems. I believe that by participating in the Base Hackathon, I can contribute to this innovation movement by building tools that make blockchain more accessible and efficient for the community. Gas fees remain a barrier to widespread adoption, and I want to create solutions that make blockchain more affordable, especially for small transactions which are common in a diverse and populous country like India.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nI am focusing on the challenge of high gas fees, particularly when multiple transactions need to be executed. This is a major issue for users in India who want to interact with dApps, mint NFTs, or transfer assets, but find transaction costs prohibitive. The challenge is to make blockchain interactions more affordable and efficient without compromising on security.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nGas Saver helps users bundle several transactions into a single operation, reducing the overall gas cost. By allowing users to batch token transfers, contract calls, or other interactions into one transaction, we can optimize the use of gas and make blockchain interactions more affordable, particularly for frequent users. This tool can encourage more adoption of blockchain services in India by making them more cost-effective.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the main technical challenges was optimizing the gas usage for the batch transactions. While batching can reduce overall fees, each individual transaction still incurs some gas cost, so I had to ensure that the smart contract was efficient in its execution. Another challenge was integrating the frontend with Metamask for seamless user experience, particularly handling multiple signatures for different transactions in the bundle. I overcame these hurdles by conducting extensive testing using Hardhat and Ethers.js, and optimizing smart contract execution using Solidity best practices."

    "descriptionFull": "## Why are you participating for Based India?\n\nWe are a trio of fervent innovators, blending our expertise in web3, development, and AI. Our motivation to dive into Based India\u2019s Buildathon comes from an unyielding passion to leverage blockchain in a way that empowers both creators and learners within our community. The power of onchain technology is colossal\u2014it\u2019s transparent, secure, and borderless. By harnessing this, we see a world where education isn\u2019t just a one-way street, but an ecosystem where creators are fairly rewarded, and learners can confidently validate their skills with certifiable proof.\n\nAt the heart of our mission is a vision of accessible, verifiable education. We want to uplift those in India, where resources are sometimes scarce, by providing a platform that transforms knowledge into real, verifiable achievements. Being part of Based India offers us not just the chance to build something impactful but also the opportunity to connect with like-minded builders and creators. The energy of a regional Buildathon is unmatched\u2014it\u2019s not just about building projects, but about building communities and pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the world of decentralized education.\n\nThe Base ecosystem, with its robust and scalable infrastructure, is the perfect playground for our vision. It's not just about participating; it\u2019s about rising, learning, and contributing to something greater\u2014a global, connected, and empowered community. We\u2019re here not just to take part but to lead the charge in reshaping the future of learning. And how can we not mention? The global stage beckons us! It\u2019s the perfect stage for Credibly, and we\u2019re ready to dazzle.\n\n## What challenges are you focusing on?\n\nWe are laser-focused on two key pain points that plague today\u2019s learners and creators:\n\n1. Access to Affordable Learning & Skill Validation\nEducation is a right, not a privilege. Yet, many learners today struggle to find affordable resources that not only teach them but provide concrete validation of their skills. Most online courses fall short in validating real-world, job-ready capabilities. Employers hesitate to trust certificates without robust backing, leaving learners stranded in a no-man\u2019s-land of uncertain credentials.\n\n2. Empowering Creators & Rewarding Learning\nContent creators pour their hearts and expertise into their work, yet they lack adequate ways to monetize and engage with their audience in a meaningful, rewarding way. With the current systems, creators are often underpaid and under-recognized, while learners don't get the full value they deserve. There\u2019s a profound need for a system where creators are rewarded for the value they bring, and learners can prove their learning effectively.\n\n## How does your submission address this challenge?\n\nCredibly is more than a platform; it\u2019s a revolution in the way we learn and validate our skills. Our platform empowers YouTube creators to seamlessly transform their educational videos into structured, interactive courses. Through our dynamic AI-powered quizzes and validation methods, learners get an immersive, interactive learning experience. No more passive watching! We turn viewers into active learners.\nBut the magic doesn\u2019t stop there. Upon successful completion of a course, learners can mint a certificate as an NFT. This NFT isn\u2019t just a digital badge; it\u2019s a verifiable, immutable, onchain proof of their skills\u2014tangible and shareable anywhere. These certificates live on the blockchain, forever securing the credibility of the learner\u2019s achievements.\nFor creators, it\u2019s a goldmine. They can monetize their educational content like never before with revenue-sharing models, earning their fair share for the value they create. More than that, they can engage with their audience in an impactful way, turning viewers into learners and learners into lifelong advocates.\nBy building Credibly on the Base platform, we leverage the power of decentralized, onchain solutions to create a secure, transparent ecosystem. Learners and creators alike can trust the integrity of the platform. It\u2019s affordable, scalable, and most importantly, it democratizes education by breaking down barriers of accessibility and validation.\n\nContract Address : 0xD2D5B17f9a0c65115A849EE0ceD25F225bf53Aca\nNFT minted Transaction Hash : 0xaa7cb6a96c615e1da621f5ba2d0b573c1a3d971df70ee14273c5489e999228b0\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding something groundbreaking is rarely smooth sailing! Here are a few hurdles we had to vault over:\n\n1.Technical Challenges with Testnet Integration\nNFTs are the future, but oh, the testnets! We faced roadblocks when deploying NFTs on the OpenSea Testnet, which greeted us with server errors at every corner. Imagine working tirelessly on deploying smart contracts only to be met with endless loading screens. Talk about a patience test! Additionally, testing wallet interactions on wallet.coinbase.com was a trial, as the site just refused to cooperate, seemingly stuck in a never-ending loop. We persevered, though, by simulating transactions elsewhere and refining our deployment process. Who knew a little tenacity could outwit tech gremlins?\n\n2.Balancing Onchain with AI & Web3\nCombining the futuristic beauty of AI-based quiz generation with the rigid structure of onchain validation felt like taming a wild horse. Both powerful in their own right, but getting them to play nice was tricky. We resolved this by meticulous testing and refining our API workflows until we had a finely tuned machine capable of supporting our complex vision.\n\n3.User Experience vs. Security\nAh, the age-old dance between UX and security! We knew from the get-go that users needed a seamless, smooth experience, but we refused to cut corners on security. We had to balance lightning-fast authentication with bulletproof security protocols\u2014a process that took multiple iterations but ultimately gave us a platform we can be proud of, one that\u2019s safe and easy to use.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nDespite the challenges, we didn\u2019t just stop at the basics! We expanded Credibly with some killer new features:\n1. Google Authentication Integration\nWith G-Auth, creators no longer need to juggle multiple platforms. They can easily log in and select videos from their YouTube channel to turn into structured courses with a few clicks. It\u2019s as easy as uploading a new video!\n2. Dynamic Course Validation\nWe supercharged our AI quiz system. Now, no learner gets the same set of questions twice. This not only keeps things fair but also ensures that learners are continuously challenged, making the learning journey both fun and rigorous.\n3. Onchain NFT Minting\nPerhaps our proudest feature! After completing a course, learners can mint an NFT certificate, forever etched on the blockchain. This certificate becomes a shareable proof of skills, verifiable by anyone, anywhere, at any time. Learning has never been this rewarding.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nWhile online social platforms connect people globally, discovering and participating in spontaneous, local, in-person interactions can be cumbersome. Existing solutions often require planning and navigating separate apps.\n\n\"Base Buzz\" is a lightweight mini-app designed for seamless integration within social feeds on Base, enabling users to effortlessly create and discover spontaneous local meetups. By leveraging the social graph and location services, it facilitates real-time, in-person connections based on shared interests or immediate availability.\n\nUsers can quickly create a \"Buzz\" specifying an activity, location radius, timeframe, and optional vibe tags directly within their feed. Nearby users can discover these Buzzes and join with a single tap, opening a temporary chat for coordination. The ephemeral nature of Buzzes encourages immediate action and real-world interaction.\n\nLeveraging MiniKit & Social Graph: MiniKit allows for direct distribution within the social feed, ensuring high visibility and low friction for adoption. By tapping into the existing social graph on Base, users can discover Buzzes from their network and connect with like-minded individuals in their vicinity.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDeveloping Base Buzz presented several interesting challenges. Integrating location services with the Base blockchain and MiniKit proved complex. We addressed the location data challenge by using a combination of the device's GPS for accuracy and network location services as a fallback, and implemented a distance filtering algorithm to only display relevant nearby \"Buzzes\". This approach also helped to conserve battery life.\n\nCreating a user-friendly interface within the constraints of a mini-app required careful design and optimization. We used React and Material UI to build a responsive and intuitive UI, focusing on clear calls to action and a simplified flow for creating and joining Buzzes.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of \"Buzzes\" introduced state management challenges. We solved this by using a combination of local state for immediate UI updates and smart contract events to ensure that all users had a consistent view of active Buzzes.\n\nFinally, ensuring scalability and responsiveness of the application within the Base ecosystem, while minimizing transaction costs, was a key consideration throughout the development process. We optimized our smart contracts to reduce gas usage and implemented efficient data fetching strategies on the frontend.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nMany entertainment applications onchain primarily focus on tokenized assets or payments, often feeling disconnected from the core user experience. There's an opportunity to deeply integrate a user's onchain identity to create truly unique and personalized entertainment experiences.\n\nBase Persona is an entertainment application that leverages a user's onchain identity on Base to unlock exclusive features, content, and personalized experiences. By recognizing the ownership of specific onchain assets, the app creates a deeper connection between the user's onchain activity and their entertainment within the platform.\nProduct: Users connect their Base wallet to \"Base Persona.\" Based on their onchain holdings (e.g., Basenames, specific NFTs, token balances), they gain access to unique aspects of the entertainment experience, such as exclusive storylines, character customizations, in-game rewards, or influence over the application's evolution. The specific entertainment format can vary, allowing for diverse applications of this core concept.\nLeveraging Onchain Identity: By utilizing Basenames and Smart Wallets for easier onboarding and recognizing the ownership of various onchain assets, \"Base Persona\" creates a novel link between a user's onchain presence and their entertainment experience, fostering a sense of digital ownership and personalized engagement.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe development of Base Persona, a project aimed at visualizing and evolving onchain identity on the Base blockchain, was not without its trials. We set out to create a user experience where a user's activity on Base directly shaped their digital representation, a concept both novel and ambitious.\n\nInitially, integrating the dynamic nature of onchain data with a compelling visual evolution system proved to be a significant hurdle. The challenge was not merely displaying static data, but rather translating a constant flow of transactions and interactions into a meaningful and engaging progression for the user's Persona. Traditional approaches fell short, and we found ourselves exploring uncharted territory in real-time data visualization within a blockchain context.\n\nThen came the issue of scalability. We were building for Base, with the expectation of a growing user base. The naive approach of querying the blockchain for every single user interaction would quickly become unsustainable and costly. We needed a more efficient way to track and process user activity without overwhelming the system.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected challenge, the one no one saw coming, was the sheer complexity of defining \"onchain identity\" in a way that felt both intuitive and rewarding to the user. What specific actions should trigger an evolution? How many stages should there be? What visual metaphors would best represent this transformation? These were not merely technical questions, but fundamental design choices that would shape the entire user experience.\n\nOur solutions, born from necessity and a bit of creative desperation, involved a multi-layered approach. We implemented a sophisticated event-tracking system that listens for specific onchain actions relevant to Persona evolution, and we designed a state management system to efficiently store and update user progress. To address the challenge of defining onchain identity, we adopted a user-centric design process, iterating through multiple prototypes and feedback sessions to arrive at a system that felt both meaningful and fun.\n\nIn the end, what began as a technical challenge evolved into a journey of discovery, forcing us to push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of onchain identity and user experience.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nOur project, Aiax, is designed to demystify and simplify the world of Web3 finance. In an ecosystem where decentralized financial tools can often feel complex, intimidating, or inaccessible to the average user, Aiax bridges the gap by providing a user-friendly platform that guides individuals through managing, analyzing, and making decisions about their crypto assets. Whether it's tracking DeFi investments, understanding on-chain activity, or comparing financial options across decentralized protocols, Aiax empowers users to take control of their Web3 finances with confidence and clarity.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart Contract Development:\nWriting the smart contract was a challenge due to the complexity of ensuring secure, gas-efficient logic while also keeping it flexible enough to support multiple financial interactions. Debugging edge cases, avoiding reentrancy bugs, and adhering to best practices in Solidity required a lot of careful planning and testing.\n\nIntegration with Frontend and Web3 Providers:\nIntegrating the smart contract with the frontend using libraries like Ethers.js or Web3.js presented issues with wallet connectivity, handling asynchronous blockchain calls, and managing contract events in real-time. Ensuring a smooth UX while interacting with blockchain data added additional complexity.\n\nAdding AgentKit Integration:\nIncorporating AgentKit to support autonomous agents added a significant layer of complexity. I had to learn how to set up and manage agents, make them interact securely with smart contracts, and ensure they operate reliably across different blockchain conditions.\n\nIncorporating AI for Enhanced Accessibility:\nIntegrating AI to make Web3 finance more user-friendly was both exciting and difficult. The challenge was to process on-chain data into meaningful insights and present it through AI-driven recommendations or chat interfaces. Training or prompting models to respond accurately to financial queries required testing and iteration to balance helpfulness with safety.",

We're finally, finally solving this problem. We have an international product for a global market. \nThe story is an all original, tightly paced story of the next Green Ranger, stepping up to mantle to protect Humanity, along side other rangers(who die a lot).

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# Issues in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)\n\nThe voluntary carbon market (VCM) faces challenges limiting its impact:\n\n### 1. Opacity & Fragmentation\n- **Lack of transparency** in credit issuance and retirement erodes trust.\n- **Siloed markets** with varied standards cause confusion.\n\n### 2. High Intermediary Costs\n- Brokers\u2019 **high fees** (20\u201330%) cut funds for climate projects.\n- These costs limit buyer access, reducing efficiency.\n\n### 3. Accessibility Barriers\n- **Complex verification** and **costs** exclude small projects, especially in India.\n- Individual buyers face technical and financial barriers.\n\n### 4. Liquidity & Settlement Issues\n- **Slow trading** and inefficient settlements hinder liquidity.\n- Off-chain agreements and **double-counting** risks undermine trust.\n\n### How Base Carbon Canopy Solves These\n**Base Carbon Canopy**, on **Base Sepolia**, enhances the VCM:\n- **Transparency**: **ERC-1155 tokens** ensure traceable trades. A **Leaflet.js map** shows Indian projects (e.g., Gujarat methane capture). **AutoML Impact Scores** (0\u2013100), from **Estimated Annual Credits**, rank projects (e.g., \u201cScore: 85\u201d), building trust.\n- **Low Costs**: **Base\u2019s layer-2** and **1% mock USDC fee** cut overhead vs. 20\u201330% broker fees, aiding projects.\n- **Access**: **React DApp** with **MetaMask** simplifies trading. Impact Scores boost small Indian projects, aligning with **SDG 10**.\n- **Liquidity**: Smart contracts enable instant settlements. Impact Scores drive **mock USDC** trades, with on-chain retirement preventing double-counting.\nIt outperforms centralized registries, offering a stablecoin-driven solution for India\u2019s climate needs.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**1. Adapting to Keras for Impact Scores**  \n**Obstacle**: Using **Keras** instead of Auto-Keras for **AutoML Impact Scores** required manual model design, complicating the prediction of project impact (e.g., scores for Indian reforestation) due to limited ML expertise.  \n**Solution**: We studied Keras documentation, implemented a simple neural network with tuned layers, and trained it on **Estimated Annual Credits** and **SDGs**, achieving reliable scores.\n\n**2. Smart Contract Debugging**  \n**Obstacle**: Initial **Solidity** contracts had NatSpec errors in 'CarbonCredit.sol', preventing compilation, and restrictive logic (e.g., self-trade checks) hindered testing.  \n**Solution**: We fixed NatSpec errors, temporarily relaxed restrictive rules for testing, and redeployed contracts using **Hardhat** on **Base Sepolia**.\n\n**3. Web3 Library Breaking Changes**  \n**Obstacle**: **Ethers.js v6** updates caused runtime errors (e.g., \u201cunsupported addressable value\u201d) in **React DApp** contract calls due to outdated v5 syntax.  \n**Solution**: Updated frontend code (e.g., trading-section.tsx) to use **Ethers.js v6** syntax, like 'contract.target', after reviewing documentation.\n\n**4. Simplifying Blockchain for Users**  \n**Obstacle**: Blockchain complexity (e.g., MetaMask, gas fees) intimidated non-technical users.  \n**Solution**: Created a **Web3Provider** context to streamline wallet management, auto-switch to **Base Sepolia**, and provide clear feedback (e.g., loading states), enhancing DApp usability.\n\n**5. Testnet vs. Mainnet Constraints**  \n**Obstacle**: As students, we faced budget and time limits, preventing **Base Mainnet** deployment with real ETH costs.  \n**Solution**: Used **Base Sepolia testnet** for cost-free prototyping, ensuring mainnet-ready code for future scaling, with **mock USDC** simulating stablecoin trades.",

Users can track and settle expenses without worrying about high gas costs, ensuring a smooth and affordable experience.\n\nWe\u2019ve also integrated stablecoin support, allowing users to pay with USDC directly; combining fast settlement with price stability.\n\nBut BaseSplit goes beyond tracking.

Getting these three very different systems to work together seamlessly required a lot of careful structuring.\n\nSpecifically, working with Gemini\u2019s API for categorizing expenses required multiple iterations. The initial responses weren\u2019t consistent, so we had to tweak the prompt formatting and inputs to get more reliable and useful categories.\n\nAnother issue was syncing group data across multiple users in real time. We had to figure out how to merge blockchain-based transactions with Firebase's real-time updates without creating conflicts or inconsistencies.\n\nFrom a frontend perspective, handling wallet connections, fallback UI states, and user flows\u2014especially for people unfamiliar with crypto\u2014was also a tricky balance.

Current options involve manual off-ramping, delays, high fees, and poor transparency.\n\nLandlords, on the other hand, are hesitant to accept crypto due to technical complexity and regulatory concerns. As a result, Web3 professionals, freelancers, and digital nomads are stuck in a broken process every month just to pay their rent.\n\nRentPay solves this by offering a simple, direct, and compliant bridge between crypto and fiat rent payments \u2014 enabling tenants to pay in stablecoins while landlords receive INR instantly in their bank accounts. No escrow. No delay. No friction.\n\nNote: INR payouts are currently simulated due to ongoing integration of compliant crypto-to-fiat off-ramp services. Only the on-chain rent payment flow is functional at this stage.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSimulating Fiat Payouts: Since real crypto-to-fiat off-ramping isn\u2019t implemented yet, we had to simulate the INR payouts on the backend in a way that still feels real and responsive to the user. Crafting this flow without breaking immersion was tricky.\n\nListening to Smart Contract Events: Capturing RentPaid events on-chain and syncing them with our backend required careful setup using Express.js and Web3 libraries. Handling transaction confirmation delays and errors added complexity.\n\nMaintaining Sync Across Frontend, Backend, and Blockchain: Ensuring all parts of the system remained consistent and in sync during the simulated payout was a key technical challenge.",

Freelancers\n- No guaranteed payments, late or unfair compensation.\n- No proper work history or portfolio to demand better pay.\n- Exploitation and labor right violations common.\n\n3. Developers / Creators\n- Contribute to open source or side projects with zero incentives.\n- No ecosystem to monetize small productivity wins.\n\n\nOur Solution: TaskFi\n\nA Web3 productivity & earning platform on BASE where:\n\n- Users complete tasks (study, work, side projects).\n- Tasks verified via AI or community.\n- Compete in fun contests and win *PRIZE POOL*\n- A freelancer? List yourself *transparently and efficiently* all in *TASK* ecosystem.\n- Earn *$TASK tokens* as rewards \u2014 stored on blockchain as proof-of-effort.\n- Create or buy *AI agents* to boost productivity (using tokens).\n- All powered by a transparent, community-governed.\n\n\nTldr; a gamified platform of learning and building skills, gamified like duolingo and transparent like stepN \n\nBase Mainnet contract - [https://basescan.org/address/0x55811c42441e0e77364d531b8c4b987a8dc1308e](url)\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Web3 & Wallet Integration\nConnecting crypto wallets like Metamask in a smooth and beginner-friendly way was a big challenge. We had to make it feel like a regular login \u2014 not something scary or complex.\n\n2. Smart Contracts & Tokens\nBuilding the $TASK token system with transactions, contest entries, and token transfer logic took time. Making sure the contracts were secure and the rewards fair was tricky.\n\n3. AI Verification System\nWe didn\u2019t want people faking tasks. So we built a system that uses AI to verify courses completion, coding into leetcode.\n\n4. AI Agent Marketplace\nLetting users upload and sell AI tools (like GPT bots) \u2014 and tracking usage and payments \u2014 was technically complex. We had to balance user freedom with safety and proper rewards.\n\n5. Keeping the Token Economy Balanced\nWe didn\u2019t want the token to lose value. So we carefully designed ways to spend, earn, and burn $TASK, keeping the system stable and motivating.\n\n6. Making It Easy for Everyone\nNot everyone knows crypto. So we focused on simplifying the user experience \u2014 from logging in, to earning tokens, to using the AI tools \u2014 so it feels like a normal productivity app.\n\n7.

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nBusinesses often find it difficult to market themselves to drive foot traffic. According to the US Bureau of labor statistics, traditional businesses find it hard to market themselves to consumers\n\nAbout 20% of small businesses **fail by the end of their First Year.**\n\nBy the end of their fifth year, **50% go under;**\n\nAnd by the tenth year, that number rises **70 to 80%** Traditional marketing methods have limitations such as high costs and being time-consuming. These problems can be solved\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated businesses worldwide. These businesses include restaurants, theme parks as well as shopping malls. Prolonged lockdown and safe-distancing measures drastically decreased the foot traffic and revenue of these businesses, forcing them to shut down or pivot.Individual Struggles to maintain active lifestyle impacting both physical and overall well-being\n\n200K kirana stores in India only was **forced to closed** down due to rise in quick commerce\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe beta release is out now and currently being tested by over 200 users, which is great for gathering feedback. However, scaling the game remains a major challenge. Compared to other location-based games, there are many moving parts to consider. These include real-time location tracking, game balance, server infrastructure, and a need to revisit the overall game architecture to ensure it can handle a larger player base efficiently.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThe Problem: The Market Intelligence Crisis\n\nTraders today face a market that moves at the speed of code, not consensus. The explosion of data across Web3, DeFi, and traditional finance has created an environment where information overload, static tools, and opaque intelligence have become the new barriers to alpha.\n\nWhat Are We Solving For?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information Overload:\nAccording to JP Morgan\u2019s 2024 Crypto Market Report, traders process less than 10% of available market data. 80% of institutional investors cite \u201cdata overload\u201d as their primary barrier to effective trading decisions.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Complexity & Analysis Paralysis:\nTraders manually monitor 50+ sources across social, on-chain, and off-chain data. 67% report \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d as a direct cause of missed opportunities and poor decisions.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Static Tools in Dynamic Markets:\n72% of trading strategies become ineffective within six months because legacy models can\u2019t adapt to 24/7, multi-chain volatility.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Opaque, Centralized Intelligence:\nKey market data is controlled by closed platforms, with little transparency into how signals are generated or how narratives are formed. This leaves traders reacting, not anticipating.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market Manipulation & Hidden Risk:\nWhales, institutions, and influencers shape narratives and liquidity flows behind the scenes. Retail and even many professional traders are left in the dark, often becoming exit liquidity.\n\nData behind the Problem\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<10% of market data is processed by traders (JP Morgan, 2024)3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a080% of institutional investors cite data overload as a primary barrier (Fidelity Digital Assets Survey, 2023)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a067% of traders report analysis paralysis (Goldman Sachs Digital Asset Report, 2023)3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a072% of strategies decay within six months due to lack of adaptability (Goldman Sachs, 2023)\n\n\n\u201cInstitutions control the data. Whales manipulate the flow. Influencers sell the narrative. What if you could see it all?\u201d\n\nHow Alphai Solves It\n\nAlphai is the Intelligence Grid for the Multi-Chain Era\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Artificial Financial Intelligence (AFI):\nAlphai isn\u2019t just another dashboard. It\u2019s your personal market brain, engineered for Web3. Our proprietary intelligence stack detects narrative formation before virality, maps liquidity flows across fragmented pools, and tracks institutional capital before it moves the market\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adaptive, Real-Time Edge:\nVertical AI agents specialize in every market sector, learning and evolving with the market. Pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics run 24/7-so you can see tomorrow\u2019s patterns in today\u2019s chaos\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actionable, Transparent Signals:\nInstead of drowning you in noise, Alphai delivers clear, actionable signals-narrative shifts, smart money flows, security risks-before they become obvious. Every insight is verifiable, every edge is engineered, not found\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Every Trader:\nWhether you\u2019re a solo degen, a prop desk, or an institution, Alphai transforms multi-chain complexity into strategic alpha. Front-run the front-runners. Weaponize information asymmetry. Convert chaos into clarity\n\n\u201cIn the age of information warfare, Alphai isn\u2019t just a tool-it\u2019s an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nTL;DR\nAlphai solves the crisis of market intelligence by turning chaos into clarity, noise into  data into dominance-giving you the edge to outthink, outpace, and outperform the market\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges we are facing while building the entire spectrum of market intelligence-social signals, onchain transactions, market feeds, quant analytics, and offchain events. Each data type brought its own battlefield:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Social Data:\u00a018,000+ Telegram groups, 4,000+ Twitter KOLs, Reddit, Discord, and news feeds-all scanned 24/7. Most sources are private, ephemeral, or flooded with spam and bots. APIs are rate-limited, blocked, or constantly changing. Extracting real alpha from meme noise and coordinated FUD is a never-ending arms race.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Onchain Data:\u00a030+ blockchains, each with unique quirks, latency, and breaking changes. Normalizing, deduplicating, and correlating millions of transactions per second is a massive engineering lift-especially when tracking smart money flows and hidden arbitrage across fragmented pools.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market Data:\u00a0Order books, ETF inflows, market maker activity, liquidation maps, options models-sourced from both CEXs and DEXs. True tick-by-tick data is expensive, fragmented, and often siloed behind paywalls or proprietary APIs. Real-time synchronization with other data layers is a challenge few have solved.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quant Data:\u00a0Volatility surfaces, correlation matrices, impact models, backtested strategies, anomaly detection-requiring high-fidelity, clean data as input. Garbage in, garbage out. Models must constantly recalibrate as market regimes shift.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offchain Data:\u00a0Token vesting schedules, funding rounds, dev activity, governance proposals, regulatory filings-often buried in PDFs, spreadsheets, or obscure forums. Scraping, parsing, and structuring unstructured data at scale, and verifying its accuracy and timeliness, is a major lift.\nThe Challenge:\nBuilding scalable, resilient crawlers and scrapers that could access, filter, and deduplicate petabytes of noisy, unstructured data-without missing the alpha buried in the chaos.\n\nThe Reality:\nEvery day, we fought API bans, captchas, DDoS attacks, and data fragmentation. We engineered our own distributed scraping infrastructure, rotating proxies, and real-time data validation pipelines. And that was just to get the raw data-before intelligence, before alpha, before edge.\n\n2.\u00a0The Intelligence Layer: Turning Data Into Alpha\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not just processing, but understanding:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had to build deep learning, NLP, and reinforcement learning models that could \u201cthink like a trader,\u201d not just regurgitate data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Challenge: Preventing hallucinations, bias, and overfitting in a world where narratives change overnight.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solution: Custom pipelines, human-in-the-loop validation, and continuous retraining on live market data.\n\n3.\u00a0Infrastructure & DevOps: Scaling the Matrix\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Massive scale, lean resources:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Orchestrating microservices, distributed crawlers, and real-time analytics across cloud and bare metal-without the luxury of infinite budgets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Challenge: Keeping latency low, uptime high, and costs sustainable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solution: Custom autoscaling, monitoring, and rapid incident response.",

Thus, the idea is to help foster a community-driven ecosystem whereby newcomers (noobs) may be able to learn from high-reputation individuals within the community. The user's reputation, in turn, grows with use of the application based on the contributions and general involvement and participation. More advanced reputation unlocks access to better mentorship, but all members are given valuable learning resources, even at lower reputations. It will be a community-oriented setting in which even beginners can have an opportunity to flourish and ensure that even beginners have a chance to learn with experienced professionals.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIntegrating Frontend and Backend: Coordinating the frontend interface with the blockchain backend, especially while implementing smart contracts and wallet integration, proved difficult. Ensuring smooth communication and data flow was key.\n\nFiguring out XNFTs: Understanding how to work with XNFTs (cross-chain NFTs) and integrating them into the dApp was a complex task. The learning curve involved managing their unique properties across different blockchains.\n\nGetting a Hash Transaction: Setting up and troubleshooting hash transactions to be correctly recorded on the blockchain was another challenge. Ensuring the transaction was properly signed and validated by smart contracts was crucial for transaction integrity.\n\nit was our first time building on base and smartwallet soo found it hard to set it up will try to finish it up within few weeks or so and finialze it",

Deploying a production-ready server without friction\n\nIntentWallet solves this by providing a minimal, modular, and scalable boilerplate for intent-driven applications.\nIt offers an Express + TypeScript backend with automatic logging, raw body capture, JSON introspection, Vite-powered frontend development, and seamless Railway deployment.\n\nThis allows developers to focus on building intent logic instead of fighting framework setup.\nWith IntentWallet, building modern intent-based dApps or payment flows becomes much faster, cleaner, and more reliable.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Raw Body Parsing for Verification**\nHandling raw request bodies (for signature verification or webhook flows) conflicted with Express\u2019 JSON middleware.\nI solved this by creating a custom middleware that captures raw data before parsing.\n\n**Shared Server Instance for WebSocket Upgrades**\nI needed both Express routes and potential WebSocket upgrades from a single server instance.\nThe fix was exporting the server reference and restructuring the initialization logic.\n\n**Vite + Express Integration**\nRunning a full-stack dev environment with hot reload on both backend and frontend was tricky.\nI solved it by conditionally enabling Vite in development and static serving in production.\n\n**Railway Deployment Port Issues**\nRailway assigns dynamic ports, which initially caused binding failures.\nThis was fixed by using process.env.PORT and binding to 0.0.0.0.\n\n**Maintaining Clean Route Structure**\nExpress projects often get messy as they grow.\nI designed a registerRoutes loader that automatically registers modular routes.\n\nThese challenges helped me build a cleaner, scalable foundation for future intent-based applications.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThis project solves the problem of trust and automation in lotteries by creating a fully decentralized, transparent, and autonomous system. Traditional lotteries often require a central authority to manage ticket sales, pick winners, and distribute prizes, which introduces risks like manipulation, fraud, or human error. This DApp removes that dependency by using smart contracts on Ethereum-compatible networks to handle all aspects of the lottery.\n\nParticipants can buy tickets by sending ETH, and the winner is randomly selected using Chainlink VRF, which provides verifiable and tamper-proof randomness. The process is fully automated using Chainlink Automation (Keepers), which triggers winner selection once certain conditions are met, without requiring any manual intervention. The winner automatically receives the prize, and the lottery resets for the next round.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building the decentralized lottery DApp, I faced several hurdles, particularly around Chainlink VRF integration and Automation:\n\nGetting Verifiable Randomness (VRF) to Work Properly\n\nIssue: Initially, the contract wasn\u2019t receiving the random number from Chainlink VRF. The fulfillRandomWords() function wasn\u2019t being called, which broke winner selection.\n\nCause: I had misconfigured the subscription ID, Key Hash, and VRF Coordinator address in the deployment scripts.\n\nSolution: I carefully reviewed the Chainlink documentation, created a proper subscription in the VRF Subscription Manager, added the contract as a consumer, and updated all values in the scripts. After redeploying, the VRF started returning valid random numbers reliably.\n\nAutomating the Lottery Draw with Chainlink Keepers\n\nIssue: The automated draw wasn\u2019t triggering because checkUpkeep() always returned false.\n\nCause: My conditions for upkeep weren\u2019t aligning correctly with the contract state (time interval, player count, and balance checks).\n\nSolution: I logged the contract state and carefully adjusted the logic in checkUpkeep() to accurately reflect when the lottery should run. After that, Keepers successfully triggered performUpkeep().\n\nFrontend\u2013Smart Contract Integration\n\nIssue: Connecting the Next.js frontend to the deployed contract was tricky, especially for reading live contract state and sending transactions.\n\nSolution: I leveraged ethers.js with proper provider, signer, and contract instances, and tested each function incrementally. This approach made the frontend responsive and reliable.",

Executive Summary**\n*Problem:*\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often face critical cash flow issues due to delayed payments on invoices. Traditional invoice financing solutions are costly, involve manual processing, and are inaccessible to many small businesses.\n\n*Solution:*\nFundora leverages blockchain technology to tokenize invoices as NFTs and provides instant liquidity in USDC through decentralized liquidity pools. By using smart contracts on the Base network, we ensure automation, transparency, and lower fees. SMEs can upload invoices and receive funding instantly, while DeFi investors earn yield by backing real-world assets.\n\n*Why Base?:*\nBase offers low-cost and high-throughput transactions, making micro-financing scalable and efficient. Its robust stablecoin ecosystem and strong developer support make it an ideal host for Fundora.\n\n**3. Problem Statement**\n*SME Cash Flow Gap:*\nOver 60% of SMEs report operational disruptions due to delayed receivables.\n\n*Centralized Financing Limitations:*\nTraditional invoice factoring involves high fees (2\u20135%), manual verification processes, and limited access for smaller businesses.\n\n*DeFi Fragmentation:*\nLack of integration with real-world assets and limited stablecoin utility in practical, business-oriented use cases.\n\n**4. Proposed Solution**\n*Invoice Tokenization:*\nMint NFTs for each invoice containing metadata like amount, due date, and credit score.\n\n*Liquidity Pools:*\nDeFi investors can deposit USDC into Base-powered pools to provide instant liquidity to SMEs.\n\n*Smart Contract Automation:*\nAll processes\u2014funding, repayment, yield distribution\u2014are handled by on-chain smart contracts.\n\nUser Dashboards:\n\n- SME Dashboard: Upload invoices, track status, and receive funds.\n\n- Investor Dashboard: View pool metrics, invest capital, and monitor returns.\n\n**5. Technical Architecture**\n\n-  Blockchain Layer: Base (Ethereum Layer 2)\n-  Smart Contracts:\n-  Written in Solidity\n-  Handles NFT minting, pool management, and yield logic\n-  Oracles: Chainlink for:\n-  Credit score fetching\n-  Exchange rate feeds\n-  Storage: IPFS for decentralized storage of invoice documents\n-  Frontend: Built using React, and Tailwind CSS\n-  Wallet Integration: MetaMask\n-  Additional Tools: Pinata Cloud for IPFS pinning\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**- Learning Curve:**\nNew to Base, so understanding its technical stack took time.\n\n**- Code Migration:**\nAdapting our existing contracts and frontend to work smoothly on Base required significant changes.\n\n**- Testnet Limitations:**\nDifficulty obtaining Sepolia test ETH (minimum 0.05 ETH required) delayed testing.\n\n**- Wallet Constraints:**\nCurrently limited to MetaMask for wallet interactions.\n\n**- Flow Refinement:**\nHad to repeatedly revise user flows for both SMEs and investors for optimal UX.\n\n**- Transaction Logic Issues:**\nIn Module 2, we are facing challenges in implementing secure and seamless transactions between SMEs and investors via smart contracts.",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nTraditional anonymous confession apps suffer from two major problems: **sustainability** and **user ranking transparency**. Most rely on distracting ads for monetization, and content feeds are rarely sorted by true community value, often letting quality content drown in noise.\n\n**Gossipp** solves this by implementing **x402 Protocol Micropayments** directly on **Base**. It makes \"spilling the tea\" sustainable and self-moderating without ads.\n\n\n---\n\n## Why Gossipp Works\n\n\n### Sustainable Monetization without Ads\nInstead of selling user data or showing ads, Gossipp uses native Web3 micropayments (**$0.01 USDC**) to unlock premium content.  \nThis aligns incentives:\n- Creators post better content to get unlocked  \n- Readers pay pennies for high-quality entertainment  \n\n### Viral Content Discovery\nThe built-in **Unlock Count** acts as a sybil-resistant ranking signal.  \nSince every unlock effectively costs money as proof of interest, the **Hot** and **Viral** rankings are tamper-proof and genuinely reflect community engagement, unlike bot-able upvotes.\n\n### Safe Anonymity\nBy hashing onchain identities (Wallet or FID) into daily-rotating **Ghost IDs** such as `Ghost-A7B2`users can express themselves freely without fear of permanent doxxing.  \nAt the same time, the system maintains cryptographic provenance to prevent spam.\n\n---\n\n## How People Can Use It\n\n- **Share Secrets Safely**  \n  Vent about life, work, or relationships anonymously.\n\n- **Discover High-Quality Gossip**  \n  Read strictly the most unlocked and verified viral stories first.\n\n- **Social Bragging**  \n  Generate beautiful, data-backed **Brag Cards** showing how much tea you have sipped and share them on Farcaster or X.\n\n- **Web3 Onboarding**  \n  A perfect low-stakes introduction to USDC and Base micropayments for non-financial fun.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## 1. Farcaster Frame Context and Local Testing\n\n**Challenge**  \nLocal Farcaster Frame development is hard due to SSL requirements and strict manifest validation. Our frame failed to render in Warpcast, and debugging user context was unclear.\n\n**Solution**  \n- Used ngrok to expose localhost:3000 over HTTPS  \n- Implemented a correct `.well-known/farcaster.json` with the exact signed key payload  \n- Mocked Frame context locally to iterate on UI without redeploying each change  \n\n---\n\n## 2. OnchainKit Wallet UI Conflicts\n\n**Challenge**  \nThe default OnchainKit connect button styling and avatar conflicted with our custom pastel, minimal UI and cluttered the header.\n\n**Solution**  \n- Applied targeted CSS overrides using `data-testid=\"ockConnectWallet_Container\"`  \n- Hid the default avatar while keeping address display and dropdown intact  \n- Preserved OnchainKit logic while matching our custom design  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Native Mobile Sharing vs Desktop\n\n**Challenge**  \nBrowsers do not allow attaching images directly to X share intents on desktop.\n\n**Solution**  \n- Implemented a hybrid flow using the Web Share API  \n- **Mobile:** Opens native share sheet with the PNG attached  \n- **Desktop:** Falls back to downloading the image for manual sharing  \n- Ensures a smooth experience without breaking browser security rules  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Next.js 16 Turbopack Compatibility\n\n**Challenge**  \nNext.js 16 Turbopack flagged our custom Webpack config used for wallet SDK polyfills.\n\n**Solution**  \n- Added an explicit `turbopack: {}` config  \n- Retained required `webpack.externals` and `resolve.fallback` settings  \n- Passed Vercel build checks while keeping crypto libraries functional",

Client Onboarding\nAs a client, you start by verifying your identity and explaining your project to an AI agent. The agent understands your needs and creates a GitHub repository, setting the stage for development.\n\n### 2. Developer Bidding\nIt then opens the project for bidding, allowing developers to apply. Each developer's GitHub is analyzed by an AI agent, which scores their experience. Their proof is verified onchain and they are onboarded onto the project.\n\n### 3. Developer Assignment\nOnce selected, the developer gets added as a collaborator and receives a dedicated branch to work on.\n\n### 4. Development & Submission\nAfter completing their module, the developer submits the module for review. The AI agent tests the feature in an AI-automated browser.\n\n### 5. Review & Merge\n- If everything works as expected, it releases funds to the developer, opens a pull request, and merges the work to the main branch.\n- If not, it raises a GitHub issue and provides feedback.\n\n## Features\n\n- AI agents handle **project management**, **quality control**, and **fund distribution**.\n- All transactions and interactions are **recorded onchain** in the **Base network**.\n- The goal is to make project execution **smooth** and **efficient**, powered by **onchain AI agents** and **zk proofs**.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Core Technology\n\nThe project\u2019s core is the **Self onchain proof system**, which uses **zero-knowledge proofs** for secure identity verification. This allows clients and developers to onboard privately without revealing sensitive data.\n\nWe also integrated **GitHub verification onchain** to assess and score developers based on their GitHub profiles, ensuring only qualified individuals are selected for the project.\n\n## Custom Plugins with Goat SDK\n\nA key component of the project was the development of two custom plugins for **Vercel** and **GitHub** within the **Goat SDK**. These plugins enabled automation of:\n\n- GitHub repository interactions\n- Deployment workflows on Vercel\n- Repository creation\n- Code pushes\n- Pull requests\n\nThese integrations bridged the AI agents with the development workflow seamlessly.\n\n## Onchain Infrastructure\n\nWe deployed the project\u2019s **smart contracts on the Base network**, ensuring that all transactions and fund releases were:\n\n- **Secure**\n- **Scalable**\n- **Eco-friendly**\n\n## Automated Testing & Fund Release\n\nFor module testing, we used the **Anchor AI browser** to automatically test code in a controlled AI environment before any fund release. This ensured that everything worked as expected prior to approving contributions.\n\n## Highlights\n\nA notable achievement was the creation of custom plugins that enabled:\n\n- Seamless service integration\n- Fully automated testing\n- Smart contract-based fund releases\n- End-to-end AI-powered project management",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nx402-streamsocket solves the gap between real-time usage and real-time payment.\n\nMost live systems today serve users continuously but charge them discretely. Once a WebSocket connection is open, there\u2019s no native, trust-minimized way to guarantee the user is still paying while consuming resources. Payment usually happens before or after usage, not during it.\n\nThis creates real problems:\n\nOverpayment: Users pay upfront even if they disconnect early.\n\nUnderpayment risk: Services keep connections open without knowing if payment still reflects usage.\n\nComplex billing logic: Developers need off-chain tracking, reconciliation jobs, refunds, and abuse protection.\n\nPoor fit for AI and agents: Autonomous systems need payment and access to stay perfectly in sync.\n\n\nx402-streamsocket fixes this by making payment itself the access signal.\n\nA Superfluid stream becomes a live proof of intent. As long as value is flowing, access continues. The moment it stops, access ends. No trust, no guessing, no cleanup",

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nDAO governance is becoming increasingly complex, but the tools available to delegates and voters have not kept up. Participants are expected to evaluate long, technical proposals, understand historical context, assess risks, and make informed decisions often under tight voting windows.\n\nThis leads to:\n\n- rushed or heuristic voting\n- over-reliance on social signals\n- low participation quality\n- overlooked governance risks\n\n## What This Project Enables\n\nThis project provides an AI-powered governance co-pilot that integrates directly into existing DAO voting interfaces (Snapshot, Uniswap Governance UI).\n\nUsers can:\n- Instantly summarize proposals\n-- Turn long governance texts into concise, structured summaries at the point of voting.\n\n- Evaluate governance risk automatically\n-- Detect missing safeguards such as escrow, timelocks, KPI verification, and treasury exposure.\n\n- Reference historical precedent\n-- Retrieve similar past proposals and outcomes to contextualize decisions.\n\n- Make informed voting decisions faster\n-- Receive an evidence-backed recommendation (YES / NO / ABSTAIN) with a confidence score.\n\nAll without leaving the governance interface.\n\n## Why x402 Micropayments Matter\n\nAI-assisted governance analysis is computationally expensive, but charging subscriptions or gating access reduces participation.\nThis project uses x402 micropayments to solve that tradeoff.\n\n- Each analysis is paid per request, not per user\n- Users only pay when they actually request AI assistance\n- No accounts, subscriptions, or centralized billing\n\nWorks seamlessly for browser extensions and autonomous agents\n\nThis enables:\n- open access to governance intelligence\n- sustainable AI services for DAOs\n- agent-mediated decision support without trust assumptions\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- Implementing x402 mincropayment middleware at client side\n- Running RAG on a non-paid, low-RAM deployment\nHosting RAG on a free-tier service required aggressive optimization. I switched to precomputed embeddings, limited document scope, and used lightweight TextRank summarization to keep memory and latency under control.\n- Injecting AI logic into an existing governance UI\nThis was my first time building a Chrome extension. Injecting scripts into third-party sites like Snapshot and Uniswap Governance required careful handling of execution contexts and wallet access, which I resolved by using content scripts + message passing instead of direct page access.",
