    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n## The Problem: Groupthink, Predictability, and Herd Behavior in Polling & Prediction Markets\nMost social polls and prediction platforms reward majority consensus, encouraging users to vote with the crowd. This system often reinforces herd mentality and suppresses contrarian or original thinking. As a result, outcomes become predictable, surface-level, and lack the nuance required to truly understand diverse public sentiment. In a time where echo chambers dominate and true opinions are often filtered, there's a growing need for a platform that values divergence over conformity.\n## How \u201cNot Your Type\u201d Solves It\nNot Your Type is a Web3-powered prediction market and social polling platform that turns traditional logic on its head: users are rewarded not for being popular, but for being unpredictable. It introduces a new kind of incentive model\u2014where choosing the least voted option earns the highest rewards. This gamifies contrarian thinking and encourages users to challenge mainstream narratives.\n- **Reverses incentive structure:** Rewards users for minority picks instead of majority consensus\n- **Unlocks contrarian insights:** Surfaces perspectives that are often overlooked or undervalued\n- **Gamifies individuality:** Makes independent thinking fun, measurable, and rewarding\n- **Real-time feedback loop:** Users can see evolving trends and adjust their strategies live\n- **Powered by Web3 wallets:** Uses thirdweb for seamless wallet integration and on-chain rewards\n- **Accessible UI:** Built with Radix UI and Tailwind for a sleek, inclusive user experience\n## Why It Matters\nBy flipping the polling model, Not Your Type enables a new form of sentiment mapping\u2014one that captures outlier behavior, emerging trends, and honest expression. In an era defined by algorithms and echo chambers, this platform gives voice to the unexpected. It's not just a tool for voting\u2014it's a playground for ideas that don\u2019t fit the mold.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest technical challenges we encountered was writing a smart contract in Solidity that could support the unique mechanics of Not Your Type including dynamic poll creation, real-time vote handling, and reward distribution for least popular choices. Achieving this while maintaining scalability, modularity, and security proved to be a complex task. We had to carefully structure the contract logic to minimize gas costs and avoid vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a game-theoretic environment. Ensuring fairness in reward logic without revealing too much on-chain was particularly tricky, and required multiple iterations and audits of our contract design.\nDuring deployment, we faced several roadblocks. Initial attempts to deploy manually led to contract size errors and configuration mismatches across different EVM-compatible networks. These issues disrupted our development flow and made it harder to test end-to-end functionality. To streamline this process, we adopted thirdweb\u2019s contract deployment tooling, which significantly reduced friction and gave us more control and visibility into deployments. It allowed us to version, manage, and redeploy contracts efficiently across testnets and mainnet environments without diving deep into manual deployment scripts.\nEven after successful deployment, integrating the contract into the frontend presented another set of challenges. Syncing on-chain data with the client in real-time, handling wallet interactions, and managing transaction states made the frontend logic more complex than expected. We resolved this by using thirdweb\u2019s React SDK, which abstracted much of the contract interaction layer and provided hooks and utilities for clean integration. This not only sped up development but also ensured a seamless experience for users\u2014from connecting their wallet to casting votes and claiming rewards\u2014all powered by a solid, scalable contract infrastructure."

Task scheduling and monitoring complexity \nOne of our most significant challenges was implementing reliable task scheduling to ensure comprehensive system monitoring. We needed a robust mechanism to track and execute scheduled tasks without omissions, which was critical for maintaining consistent monitoring across all handled platforms. We addressed this by implementing a centralized task management system with redundancy checks to verify successful execution.\n\n2. Deployment environment dependencies \nWe faced considerable difficulty getting FFmpeg pre-installed on our deployment service, which was essential for our media processing requirements. This required creating a custom Nixpacks configuration to ensure FFmpeg was properly integrated into our deployment pipeline. The solution demanded deep understanding of both our deployment environment and FFmpeg's dependencies.\n\n3. Platform isolation and system resilience rarly in development\nwe identified a critical vulnerability: if one platform's integration failed, it could potentially crash our entire backend system. To resolve this, we redesigned our architecture to use a microservices approach, where each platform's backend operated as a separate, isolated service. This architectural decision significantly improved our system's fault tolerance and stability, allowing individual platform issues to be contained without affecting the broader system.\n\n4. External api rate limits, built redundancies by using multiple sources."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nEveryone on social media is stuck in the doomscrolling loop. They are not able to find the content that is relevant and provide value to them.\n\n## Why does this problem exist?\n\nLack of personalization and context in the content that is being consumed.\n\n## What are the possible solutions to this problem?\n\nThe generic solution to this is to ask user to define their interests and preferences, and then based on that, the content is personalized.\n\nBut this is not a good or scalable solution. No one has time to define their interests or select the option to \"Not Interested\".\n\n# Solution: Realm\n\n[Realm](https://realm.megabyte0x.xyz) is the AI powered infra for providing personalized experience to users on any social media platform.\n\n## How does Realm solve the problem?\n\nRealm uses AI intelligence to understand users' post and its intent, and create a rich contextual graph for every user.\nThis contextual graph can be utilized by any social media application to provide personalized content to their users.\n\n## Implementations\n\nWe have created two implementations to showcase the power of personalized social graph created by Realm.\n\n### ReplyGuy\n\nReplyGuy is a simple agent, powered by Realm, which comments on your posts on Farcaster with other relevant posts as per the content you mentioned.\nWe got **360+ users** within a week of launch and served 16K+ replies.\n\n[Demo](https://youtu.be/wY07-IEqBNc) || [Live Link](https://replyguy.megabyte0x.xyz) || [Source Code](https://github.com/Hojaeaga/replyguy)\n\n### FarSearch\n\nFarSearch is a ChatGPT like interface, powered by Realm, which can be used to search any content on Farcaster.\n\n[Live Link](https://farsearch.megabyte0x.xyz)\n\n# How does Realm work?\n\nRealm fetches real-time content on Farcaster and analyzes the content to create a personalized graph for the user.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n1. Neynar APIs for fetching content from Farcaster.\n2. Eigen Layer AVS on Base and Ethereum.\n3. Gemini and OpenAI for generating embeddings.\n4. Supabase for storing the data.\n\n## Contracts\n\nThe following AVS contracts have been deployed on Base Sepolia (L2) and Ethereum Holesky (L1):\n- [AVS_GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xF008031601847dCDe95904bB94e1F0D9804E0e4b)\n- [ATTESTATION_CENTER_ADDRESS](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x87d95ad1730ebaeed5a8a563ce69febd7e14220a)\n\n## NOTE\n\n- We have deployed AVS on the *Base Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia testnet*, due to the cost and setup of the reward distribution mechanism for validators.\n- The only open source repo is for ReplyGuy: https://github.com/Hojaeaga/replyguy\n- If you like to access any of the private repos, please reach out to us at Telegram [@megabyte0x](https://t.me/megabyte0x) or [megabyte0x@gmail.com](mailto:megabyte0x@gmail.com).\n\n# Roadmap\n\nWe have big vision for Realm. Currently, we are using Farcaster social graph but working on to expand to other social media platforms like Telegram, X, and more.\n\nThe cross-platform social graph will be a game changer and will help us to provide the best personalized experience to users on any social media platform.\n\n# What are we looking for?\n\nWe are actively raising funds to build the scalable and robust infrastructure for Realm.\n\n# Contact Us\n\nIf you have any questions or want to discuss the project, feel free to reach out to us at Telegram [@megabyte0x](https://t.me/megabyte0x) or [megabyte0x@gmail.com](mailto:megabyte0x@gmail.com).\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAfter building the base infra (Realm), we launched an application on top of it, ReplyGuy, a simple agent which comments on your posts with the other relevant posts as per the content mentioned.\n\nIn starting, we were happy with the responses from the AI and in getting our first 120 Subscribers.\n\nLink: https://warpcast.com/yourreplyguy/0xa9cfb518\n\nBut when we looked for the feedback from the users, we found two major issues:\n\nThe reply frequency was really high.\nSometimes the reply was not relevant to the post.\nSo we sat, screamed through the night and came up with the following solution:\n\nConditional reply based on the post.\n\nExamples:\n\nIf the post is just a reply to some other post or any empty quote post, then don't reply.\nIf the post is in a channel, prioritise the content discovery from the channel.\nAnother issue was verifying that the data is being fetched from the trusted servers and replies are being generated by the AI and doesn't have any human intervention.\n\nTo fix this, we came up with the following solution:\n\nVerifiable Agent using Eigen Layer.\n\nWe built an Eigen Layer AVS on Base and Ethereum to verify the data and the replies posted by the agent, using Reclaim Protocol and Othentic stack."

Retail can control a full BTC on day one in select DeFi platforms.\n\n- Fixed-term, fixed-rate schedule: transparent EMI to turn BTC acquisition into a familiar monthly payment plan.\n\n- Liquidation anxiety of DeFi is fixed through an opt in \"Liquidation Insurance\" which is a long term put option.\n\n - In case of defaults, only micro-liquidations: only the BTC needed to cover that month\u2019s EMI is sold. \n\n- BTC-secured credit delivers yields that historically beat Aave/Compound while being over-secured in USD terms from day one.\n\n- In-app exit queue & planned secondary market lets LPs rotate out without waiting for borrower maturity.\n\n- Regulated-grade architecture on-chain escrow unlocks true under-collateralisation without custodial rehypothecation risk.\n\n**Why this matters now**\n\n- Adoption tail-winds: Bitcoin network users grow ~30 % YoY; the next 100 M retail entrants need financing.\n\n- Fresh liquidity: The newly passed GENIUS Act will legalise billions of stable-coin inflows that all need safe, yield-bearing deployment.\n\n- No direct competitors: Neither TradFi mortgages nor existing DeFi money markets offer sub-100 %-collateral BTC credit, leaving a clear gap that Bitmor fills.\n\n**Net effect**\n\n- Borrowers become \u201cfull-coiners\u201d decades sooner, capturing more upside with manageable monthly outlays.\n\n- Lenders convert stagnant stables into a diversified, hedged BTC credit book with superior yield.\n\n- The ecosystem gains a missing credit primitive that deepens liquidity, smooths volatility, and accelerates mainstream Bitcoin ownership.\n\n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/94728623b13740fc8558e5361c0c1a0f/850bd352-7d35-4a38-8606-d0e360eb2afc.png)\n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/94728623b13740fc8558e5361c0c1a0f/c1ec580b-cd85-4c14-9dbe-192057a95ed4.png)\n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/94728623b13740fc8558e5361c0c1a0f/23b1598c-dfac-474e-beb3-b93efd107e7c.png)\n\nSummary - All Deployed Contract Addresses on Base Sepolia:\n----------------------------------------\nMockDeployer:  0x45dF8BF8Ed77Fe7c7549f85edc6ca085beF82D51\nUSDC:          0x377faBD7d29562c059Dd2D3A9C41eF6974d26B21\ncbBTC:         0x905DFbD63Eb404E9A6A03B447c037EC7260478cF\nAavePool:      0x044a1Caf72d89f67a4801bB77F858C9A2795b57A\nSwapRouter:    0xb1c026CFce4478DaF34FD72cB8ac959e35823F21\nLendingPool:   0xd8c555F728aCD2441a60e0da3f2591464f364C9c\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- Creation of a liquidation Insurance which has an acceptable cost.

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**The Problem:  Barriers to DeFi Adoption**\n\nDeFi\u2019s promise of high yields and financial autonomy is hindered by significant challenges that deter mainstream adoption. Research suggests that only a small fraction of cryptocurrency users engage with DeFi platforms due to the following barriers:\n\n**Technical Knowledge Gap:** DeFi requires users to evaluate smart contract security to avoid exploits, a task requiring expertise beyond most users\u2019 capabilities. \n\n**Complex Financial Concepts:** Terms like impermanent loss, liquidity mining, and yield,staking,LST are unfamiliar to non-experts.\n\n**Gas Fee Management:** High transaction costs on blockchains like Ethereum, especially during network congestion, demand strategic timing and optimization skills. \n\n**Cross-Chain Navigation:** As DeFi expands across multiple blockchains, users needs to invest assets at different blockchains just for yields, and the challenge of using cross-chain bridges to move assets. \n\n**Rapid Protocol Evolution:** DeFi protocols frequently upgrade, introducing new features and mechanisms. \n\nThese barriers make DeFi inaccessible to billions of potential users, such as teachers, doctors, or small business owners, leaving their assets idle in wallets. Industry reports indicate that 78% of crypto owners cite complexity as the primary obstacle to DeFi engagement, highlighting a significant untapped market opportunity.\n\n**A$CE\u2019s Solution: Simplifying DeFi**\n\nA$CE tackles these challenges by offering a platform that abstracts DeFi\u2019s complexities, delivering a seamless, secure, and efficient experience. \n\n**Protocol-Agnostic Yield Generation:** A$CE enables users to deposit assets into a pool, where an AI-driven system which runs on mathematically advanced algorithms automatically routes them to the most profitable yield sources across DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Aave and others . This eliminates the need for users to research or select protocols manually, addressing the technical knowledge gap.\n\n**Institutional-Grade Security:** A$CE rigorously verifies all integrated protocols to meet high security standards, reducing the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities. This builds user confidence and mitigates concerns about protocol safety, a major barrier to adoption.\n\n**Web2-Like Interface:** By mimicking the simplicity of traditional web interfaces, A$CE removes blockchain-specific terminology and processes. This intuitive design makes DeFi accessible to users with no technical background, overcoming the complexity of financial concepts.\n\n**Multi-Asset Pool Efficiency:** A$CE aggregates user deposits to optimize gas fees, making transactions cost-effective. This pooling also allows smaller deposits to participate in yield-generating activities, broadening access to DeFi and addressing gas fee management challenges.\n\n**24/7 Automated Market Intelligence:** A$CE employs advanced algorithms that continuously monitor the DeFi ecosystem, adjusting asset allocations to maximize returns. These algorithms are mathematically sound, drawing from quantitative trading strategies used in crypto markets, similar to those in crypto quant trading, ensuring optimal performance across evolving protocols.\n\n**Future AI Personalization:** A$CE plans to introduce personalized AI agents that learn individual risk preferences and financial goals, creating tailored investment strategies. This feature, akin to services offered to high-net-worth clients, will enhance user engagement and address diverse financial needs.\n\nThese features collectively transform DeFi into a one-click experience, aligning with the needs of mainstream users who seek simplicity, security, and reliability. By leveraging mathematically sound algorithms, A$CE ensures that yield generation is both efficient and robust, further enhancing its appeal.\n\n**These are the pool that we support:**\n**Low Risk Pool**\nA conservative approach focusing on well-established pools with proven stability, high TVL (Total Value Locked), and consistent fee generation.\n\n**Medium Risk Pool**\nA balanced approach that achieves moderate risk and return. Targets pools with good trading volume and reasonable APR while maintaining acceptable volatility levels.\n\n**High Risk Pool**\nAn aggressive approach targeting maximum APR that accepts higher volatility. Focuses on newer or more volatile pools with potential for significantly higher returns.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n**No Company building experience:** If selected for the Network School Fellowship, we'll leverage this opportunity to transform A$CE from a promising product into a unicorn. Our team brings strong technical skills and a deep understanding of DeFi's challenges, but we recognize our knowledge gap in company building and go-to-market strategy.\nOther Challenges: \nThis project definitely had its challenges! Time was the biggest constraint - balancing all the features we wanted against the hackathon deadline and a full-time job was tough.\n\nI planned to implement EIP 7702 to streamline the user experience and eliminate repetitive transaction approvals, but had to prioritize core functionality first. Similarly, while I focused on making the contracts work correctly, I couldn't spend as much time on security auditing as I'd have liked."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n\ud83e\udde9 The Problem It Solves\nTraditional dungeon-crawler games are fun and immersive, but they often lack ownership, progressive incentives, and long-term value for players. Once the game ends, your efforts and progress vanish \u2014 and there's no meaningful way to monetize or carry forward your success.\n\nDarkest Dungeon changes that paradigm by merging procedural gameplay with on-chain value creation. Here's how we solve existing gaps:\n\n\ud83c\udfae 1. Lack of Player Ownership in Traditional Games\nMost games store progress off-chain and tie it to centralized systems. In Darkest Dungeon, your score, loot, and achievements can be minted on-chain, giving players true ownership of their in-game success.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 2. No Real Incentives in Roguelikes\nWhile roguelikes are engaging, they don't offer real-world rewards for high performance. We introduce Dungeon Tokens ($DGN), an ERC-20 token you can mint based on your in-game performance \u2014 giving financial incentives to skilled players and enhancing replayability.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f 3. Disconnected Gameplay and Web3\nMany Web3 games either focus too much on blockchain without good gameplay or have great gameplay with poor Web3 integration. Darkest Dungeon balances both by using Web3 only where it adds real value \u2014 such as:\n\nSaving top scores on-chain,\n\nRewarding consistent progress,\n\nUnlocking in-game perks based on on-chain history.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f 4. Static Experiences in Indie Games\nReplayability is a challenge. Our procedural dungeon generation ensures no two runs are the same, keeping players engaged through unpredictability, challenge scaling, and randomized loot/enemies.\n\n\ncontract address\nDeploying contracts using deployer address: 0x6Fd50cdB870061aAa07edD2b91b77FB148D0c686\n  Deployed Dungeon Token at address: 0x915450637EAB35Cb6D8F6538631120aE7145d902\n  Deployed Darkest Dungeon at address: 0x99d24B28241596843948952c59a8746030CC3547\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding Darkest Dungeon presented several exciting but tough challenges. Here's how we tackled them:\n\n\ud83e\uddf1 1. On-Chain Integration Without Compromising Gameplay\nChallenge: Integrating smart contracts without disrupting the Base gameplay loop was tricky. We wanted Web3 to feel like a bonus, not a barrier.\n\nSolution: We decoupled gameplay from blockchain actions. Core mechanics run client-side, while score submission and token minting happen after the run, making the Web3 experience smooth and optional for casual players.\n\n\ud83e\uddea 2. Procedural Dungeon Generation\nChallenge: Creating a dungeon that\u2019s both random and playable (e.g., guaranteed path to stairs, fair enemy distribution) required careful balancing.\n\nSolution: We developed a custom algorithm to generate rooms with path validation logic, ensuring progression without making maps too predictable or too punishing.\n\n\ud83d\udd10 3. Smart Contract Testing & Security\nChallenge: Making sure scores couldn\u2019t be spoofed or manipulated when minting tokens.\n\nSolution: We implemented basic score verification rules (e.g., timers, thresholds) and used testnets like BaseTestnet to simulate edge cases. We also scoped further protection for future versions, such as server-side validators or ZK-based proofs of score integrity.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 4. Gas Efficiency for Score Minting\nChallenge: Storing every score detail on-chain was too gas-intensive.\n\nSolution: We optimized by storing only essential metadata (e.g., final score, timestamp, player address) and pushing other data to off-chain storage (like IPFS, for future updates).\n\n\ud83e\uddf0 5. Tooling Across a Monorepo\nChallenge: Managing a Turborepo with multiple apps (apps/web, smart contracts, shared assets) led to compatibility issues with tools like Vite, Foundry, and RainbowKit.\n\nSolution: We modularized the repo using consistent pnpm workspaces and synced environment variables across layers. Careful dependency management helped us avoid version mismatches and build errors.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 6. Wallet UX for Testnets\nChallenge: Some users had trouble interacting with Base Testnet wallets due to network setup and lack of faucet availability.\n\nSolution: We provided a guided UI for connecting wallets and added fallback logic for unsupported networks. We also manually funded testers with testnet BaseEth to streamline their experience."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThis project touches different aspects of these listed problems in one way or other\n\nOne of the most important problem Kuri can solve is for people from emerging markets with high inflation rates where holding onto their native currencies is as bad as aping into a top blasted shit coin, where the chart is going down always, Kuri helps all these people to save along with their friends or family in fun and gamified manner using USD pegged stable coins, this way they could hedge against inflation to a great extend.\n\nThere are lot of frictions for capital access especially for micro loans using platforms like Kiva, and with the traditional finance there is always gonna be geo-restrictions either due to liquidity access or regulatory side, but this approach solves for all of this and as the stable coin adoption increases this is gonna help a lot of people who had very less access to traditional finance and capitals.\n\nSome of the other problems I think this or a derivative of this can be used in solving the following problems:\n\nPredatory Lending Escape: Eliminates high-cost microloans by offering a fair, time-bound system where everyone contributes and gets a turn \u2014 no one pays more than they put in.\n\nStructured Savings Discipline: Builds consistency in saving habits by introducing time-locked deposits, social accountability, and the emotional pull of a raffle-based reward.\n\nOn-Chain Trust & Transparency: Brings ROSCAs on-chain with full auditability, programmable fairness, and immutable smart contracts, removing informal system risks like fraud or mismanagement.\n\nSocial Finance Reinvigorated: Uses social trust, peer selection, and community coordination to power financial systems \u2014 replacing anonymous yield farms with meaningful, human-centered financial experiences.\n\nAccessible, Intuitive UX: Strips away DeFi complexity by grounding the product in familiar concepts like saving circles, raffles, and group goals, with a fun and refined interface.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSo one main challenge that I can think of is in integrating the chainlink vrf and making the subscription dynamic, so that every contract is being added as a consumer to one of the vrf subscriptions, I had to hop on their discord support a couple of times and later on figured out from their contracts."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nHookTuah is an innovative Uniswap V4 hook that enables single-sided liquidity provision with Just-In-Time (JIT) rebalancing, designed to make liquidity provision more accessible and capital-efficient for DeFi users. Traditionally, providing liquidity on automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap requires users to supply both tokens of a trading pair in precise ratios. This can be a barrier for users who only hold one asset, and exposes them to impermanent loss and inefficient capital usage.\n\nHookTuah addresses this by allowing users to deposit just one token (either Token0 or Token1) into a Uniswap V4 pool. The hook acts as a smart counterparty, automatically rebalancing and providing the other side of the pair as needed. During swaps, HookTuah can perform JIT rebalancing, dynamically adjusting its position to reduce impermanent loss and improve liquidity efficiency. This approach lowers the entry barrier for liquidity providers, enables more flexible capital deployment, and enhances overall pool liquidity.\n\n\n### How It Works\n\n- Single-Sided Deposits: Users deposit either token0 or token1. The hook tracks user balances and manages the pool\u2019s net position.\n- JIT (Just-In-Time) Rebalancing: During swaps or significant price movements, the hook automatically rebalances its liquidity, reducing impermanent loss and improving capital efficiency.\n- Automated Management: The hook monitors pool prices and liquidity, adjusting its strategy in real time for optimal performance.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n- Lower Barrier to Entry: Users no longer need to hold or acquire both tokens, making DeFi more accessible.\n- Reduced Risk: Automated rebalancing helps protect against impermanent loss, a major concern for LPs.\n- Protocol Efficiency: By acting as a smart counterparty, HookTuah can help pools maintain tighter spreads and deeper liquidity.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Accurate Accounting:\nEnsuring accurate tracking of user balances, net deltas, and hook-owned liquidity required careful design and extensive testing. Also taking care of edge cases, such as simultaneous deposits/withdrawals and rapid price changes, were handled by implementing robust internal accounting.\n\n## Integration with Uniswap v4:\nAdapting the hook to work seamlessly with Uniswap v4\u2019s pool manager and callback system required a deep understanding of the unidwap math.\n\n## Gas Efficiency:\nMaintaining gas efficiency while providing advanced features like JIT rebalancing and single-sided provision was challenging. Optimizations included minimizing state writes, using efficient data structures, and leveraging Solidity libraries."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nAuditHook tackles the critical need for robust and specialized security auditing in the rapidly evolving DeFi space, specifically within the Base ecosystem and with a deep understanding of Uniswap v4 hooks.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it addresses needs and improves existing solutions:\n\nAddressing Needs:\n\nGrowing Complexity of DeFi: DeFi protocols are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with innovations like Uniswap v4 hooks introducing new levels of customization and potential complexity. This increased complexity inherently creates more surface area for vulnerabilities that traditional auditing methods might miss or not fully grasp. AuditHook's specialized focus on Base and Uniswap v4 directly addresses this gap.\n\nEcosystem-Specific Security: Security considerations can vary across different blockchain ecosystems. AuditHook's optimization for the Base network ensures that its analysis is tailored to the specific nuances and potential risks prevalent within the Base environment.\n\nUniswap v4 Hook Vulnerabilities: Uniswap v4 hooks are a novel feature, and developers are still exploring their full potential. This novelty also means that established auditing tools might not have specific expertise or checks designed for the unique security challenges introduced by custom hook logic. AuditHook directly addresses this by building in awareness and specific analysis for these hooks.\n\nAccessibility and Developer Education: Security auditing can often be expensive and time-consuming, potentially hindering smaller teams or individual developers. AuditHook aims to provide a more accessible solution with its user-friendly interface and educational resources, empowering developers to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.\n\nThe Need for AI-Enhanced Analysis: Traditional static analysis tools can identify known patterns of vulnerabilities, but they might struggle with novel or more subtle exploits. Integrating AI, like Google's Gemini, allows AuditHook to leverage pattern recognition and potentially identify more complex and nuanced security risks.\n\nGas Optimization as a Security Consideration: Inefficient smart contracts can be more expensive to operate and might even introduce security risks in certain scenarios (e.g., gas exhaustion attacks). AuditHook's gas optimization detection helps developers write more efficient and potentially more secure code.\nImproving Existing Solutions:\n\nSpecialized Focus: Unlike generic smart contract auditors, AuditHook offers a targeted approach optimized for the Base network and with specific intelligence regarding Uniswap v4 hooks. This specialization allows for more in-depth and relevant analysis.\n\nAI Integration for Deeper Analysis: By incorporating AI, AuditHook goes beyond traditional static analysis, potentially identifying vulnerabilities that might be missed by less advanced tools.\nIntegrated Educational Resources: AuditHook doesn't just point out problems; it aims to educate developers by providing context, best practices, and links to relevant documentation, fostering a more security-conscious development community on Base.\n\nUser-Friendly Design: The platform's focus on a clean and interactive user interface makes security auditing more accessible to a wider range of developers, regardless of their security expertise.\n\nEarly and Continuous Auditing: By offering a potentially more cost-effective and user-friendly solution, AuditHook encourages developers to integrate security auditing earlier and more frequently in their development process, rather than treating it as a late-stage gatekeeper.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of AuditHook, we encountered several notable obstacles that tested our technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Here's a look at some of them and how we navigated through these challenges:\n\n1. Integrating AI (Google's Gemini) for Smart Contract Analysis:\n\nChallenge: Effectively leveraging the Gemini AI API to understand and identify complex smart contract vulnerabilities proved to be a significant hurdle. Initial outputs from the AI sometimes lacked the specificity and actionable insights we aimed for. Training the AI or prompting it in a way that yielded accurate and relevant security findings required extensive experimentation and fine-tuning of the prompts.\n\nOvercoming: We iteratively refined our prompting strategies, providing the AI with more context about common Solidity vulnerabilities, secure coding best practices, and the specific nuances of the Base and Uniswap v4 environments. We also implemented a post-processing layer to interpret and structure the AI's output into a user-friendly format with clear recommendations and severity ratings. This involved carefully mapping AI-identified patterns to known vulnerability categories.\n\n2. Developing Specialized Analysis for Uniswap v4 Hooks:\n\nChallenge: Uniswap v4 hooks are a relatively new concept, and comprehensive documentation and established best practices were still evolving during our development. Building an analysis module that could effectively identify potential risks and inefficiencies unique to hook implementations required deep diving into the Uniswap v4 codebase and understanding the various lifecycle hooks and their potential interactions.\n\nOvercoming: Our team dedicated significant time to studying the Uniswap v4 documentation and example hook implementations. We built a set of custom static analysis rules specifically targeting common pitfalls in hook development, such as incorrect state management within hooks, potential reentrancy issues arising from external calls within hooks, and gas optimization opportunities unique to hook execution. We also created synthetic Uniswap v4 pool scenarios to test our analysis logic.\n\n3. Ensuring Accurate and Efficient Onchain Interactions with OnchainKit:\n\nChallenge: Interacting with the Base mainnet and retrieving relevant blockchain data for analysis and user feedback required a solid understanding of OnchainKit. We faced challenges in efficiently fetching contract bytecode, transaction data, and potentially relevant state variables. Ensuring these interactions were performant and didn't introduce latency into the analysis process was crucial for a good user experience.\n\nOvercoming: We optimized our data fetching strategies using OnchainKit's provided utilities and explored asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the main application thread. We also implemented caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce redundant calls to the blockchain. Thorough testing on the Base testnet helped us identify and resolve potential issues related to network connectivity and data consistency.\n\n4. Designing a User-Friendly Interface for Complex Audit Results:\n\nChallenge: Presenting complex security audit findings, gas optimization suggestions, and AI-generated insights in a clear, concise, and actionable manner was a design challenge. We wanted to avoid overwhelming users with technical jargon and instead provide them with understandable explanations and clear next steps.\n\nOvercoming: We adopted a user-centered design approach, iterating on the UI based on feedback and usability principles. We utilized the Shadcn UI component library to create a visually appealing and well-structured interface. We employed clear labeling, severity indicators, code snippets with highlighted issues, and expandable sections for detailed explanations and recommendations. The \"Export Report\" and \"Share\" functionalities were also prioritized to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n5. Balancing Feature Development with Buildathon Timeline:\n\nChallenge: The buildathon's time constraints required us to prioritize key features and make strategic decisions about what could be realistically implemented within the given timeframe. We had many ambitious ideas, but we needed to focus on delivering a core, functional product that showcased the unique value proposition of AuditHook.\n\nOvercoming: We adopted an agile development methodology with short sprints and regular team communication. We identified the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that would demonstrate the core AI-powered analysis and Uniswap v4 hook integration. We made conscious decisions to defer less critical features for future iterations, ensuring we had a polished and functional submission for the buildathon."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nCloud computing and GPU-based computing are heavily centralized, often controlled by a few large corporations, leading to expensive and restricted access for developers, researchers, and startups. With AI models requiring massive computing power, there's a rising demand for scalable, affordable, and censorship-resistant compute resources.\n\nHive addresses this by creating a decentralized GPU-sharing platform. It enables individuals to contribute their idle GPU power to a global network and allows users to rent this power for AI, rendering, or other intensive tasks. Using blockchain ensures transparent usage, fair rewards, and trustless coordination between GPU providers and users.\n\nThis democratizes access to computing resources, lowers costs, and reduces reliance on centralized cloud giants.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart contract design for trustless payment: Designing an incentive system that fairly rewards GPU providers without centralized arbitration was tricky. We implemented a reputation + escrow-based system for trust.\n\nVerification of real GPU contributions: Ensuring that shared resources are actually being used as promised was a technical challenge. We explored off-chain monitoring and cryptographic proof-of-work validation methods.\n\nDecentralized matchmaking system: Matching GPU supply and demand in a distributed network required designing a light yet efficient peer-to-peer protocol.\n\nUser onboarding complexity: Web3 interfaces and wallet integration are still confusing for new users. We added a guided onboarding UI and used libraries like Web3Modal to simplify wallet connection.\n\nDeployment scalability: Testing real-time workloads on a decentralized GPU network needed containerization and monitoring. We used Docker and Grafana for performance testing and feedback."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**The Problem: Urban Mapping Isn\u2019t Keeping Up**\n\nCities are growing fast, but the tools we use to navigate them are stuck in the past. Most current mapping systems rely on static, outdated, or incomplete data\u2014leading to:\n\n- Inaccurate directions and poor route planning\n- Delayed awareness of road hazards or traffic changes\n- Limited insights into what\u2019s really happening on the ground\n- No way to predict issues before they happen\n\nIn short, the maps we use don\u2019t reflect the real-time rhythm of the cities we live in.\n\n**Our Solution: PathPulse.ai \u2013 Smarter Mapping from the Ground Up**\n\nPathPulse.ai is building the next generation of urban mobility technology. By transforming raw video and metadata from everyday vehicle dashcams into live, intelligent, and decentralized maps, we\u2019re creating a system that reflects the actual state of the city\u2014right now.\n\n**What Makes Us Different**\n\n1. *Crowdsourced AI Mapping*: Every driver becomes a data contributor. As vehicles move, real-time video and metadata are used to update maps far more frequently and accurately than traditional systems.\n2. *Predictive AI with PulseNet*: Our platform doesn\u2019t just report what\u2019s already happened\u2014it predicts what\u2019s about to. Using advanced pattern recognition, we can foresee traffic jams, accidents, and road issues before they even occur.\n3. *Millimaps (A New Layer of Digital Maps)*: We\u2019re not just making maps more accurate\u2014we\u2019re rethinking what maps are. Our \u201cMillimaps\u201d are living, digital twins of cities that reflect not just geography, but also real-time social, environmental, and economic activity.\n4. *Community-Powered with $PULS Rewards*: Users who contribute valuable data earn $PULS tokens. This incentive structure builds a vibrant, self-sustaining community of drivers and data providers who keep the system active and reliable.\n5. *End-to-End Hardware + Software*: We design both the hardware and the software, ensuring high-quality, AI-optimized data across different regions and driving conditions.\n6. *Open to All*: With the Pulse Scout app and our easy-to-use devices, anyone\u2014from taxi drivers to delivery fleets\u2014can participate and benefit from the system.\n\n**How It Works**\n\n- We combine real-time analytics, predictive AI, and big data\n- Our system processes micro-level driving data to reveal patterns most systems miss\n- Navigation maps update in real time as new data flows in\n- City planners, businesses, and drivers get insights based on real-world conditions, not assumptions\n\n**Where It\u2019s Used**\n\n- Detecting road hazards and incidents as they happen\n- Optimizing delivery and transit routes in real time\n- Helping cities plan and maintain infrastructure proactively\n- Monitoring traffic and environmental patterns\n- Rewarding users who contribute data through a token-based system\n\n**The Bigger Impact**\n\n*PathPulse.ai is more than a mapping tool\u2014it\u2019s a real-time intelligence layer for cities. By blending predictive AI, community-powered data, and cutting-edge hardware, we\u2019re enabling smarter, safer, and more sustainable mobility systems. This is the future of how cities move\u2014and how we move through them.*\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Problem 1: Multi-Device Camera Integration**\n\n***Challenge:***\nIntegrating dash cams from multiple car manufacturers proved difficult due to variations in camera hardware specifications, data transmission protocols, and lack of standardized interfacing methods.\n***Solution:***\nWe addressed this issue using *SPTP (Simple Picture Transfer Protocol) sniffing*. By establishing a local server, we redirected the camera data streams to a centralized host through protocol sniffing and custom-built handlers. This abstraction allowed our application to interface seamlessly with a wide variety of dash cams, ensuring stable and consistent data ingestion across multiple devices.\n\n\n**Problem 2: Lack of Training Data for Model Development**\n\n***Challenge:***\nThere was a scarcity of relevant real-time annotated data required to train the AI models, particularly for identifying road features such as accident-prone zones, street lighting conditions, and object classification in diverse conditions.\n***Solution:***\nTo overcome this, we launched a *data collection campaign*, recruiting a team of volunteers to gather real-world footage. Volunteers were instructed to capture specific image data and metadata such as GPS coordinates and timestamps. These curated datasets allowed us to develop a robust training pipeline for our AI model, incorporating edge-case scenarios and enhancing detection accuracy across diverse urban and rural landscapes.\n\n\n**Problem 3: Integration Limitations of YOLO with Telematics Hardware**\n\n***Challenge:***\nThe YOLO object detection model, while accurate, was computationally intensive and incompatible with the limited processing capacity of our in-vehicle telematics hardware.\n***Solution:***\nWe developed a proprietary lightweight object detection model named PulseNet. PulseNet was engineered specifically for edge deployment\u2014it is faster, consumes fewer resources, and delivers accurate and precise results under real-time constraints. This enabled seamless AI inference directly on the telematic device without compromising speed or accuracy.\n\n\n**Problem 4: Inability to Determine Contextual Object Positioning**\n\n***Challenge:***\nAlthough PulseNet was effective in detecting objects, it lacked the ability to provide contextual spatial information, such as whether the object appeared on the left, right, or center of the road\u2014critical for navigation and road behavior analysis.\n***Solution:***\nTo resolve this, we introduced an extension module called PulseGen, designed to compute contextual positioning metadata. PulseGen works alongside PulseNet to analyze object placement relative to road geometry, thus enabling the system to identify lane-specific object locations. This improvement allowed for the generation of highly accurate and geo-contextualized mapping data."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nSiloed Prediction Markets\nTraditional platforms are locked within single blockchains, limiting liquidity, participation, and interoperability across ecosystems.\n\nComplex User Experience\nUsers need to manage multiple wallets and bridges manually, which creates friction and discourages widespread adoption.\n\nLack of High-Impact Prediction Focus\nMany platforms center around trivial topics rather than meaningful, globally significant questions (e.g. climate, elections, health crises).\n\nSecurity & Integrity Challenges\nCentralized or poorly designed platforms are vulnerable to manipulation, fake accounts, and sybil attacks, undermining trust.\n\nHigh Barriers to Entry\nTechnical complexity, unclear UX, and unclear incentives discourage new users from joining or contributing.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nCross-Chain Communication Complexity\nDesigning a seamless cross-chain user experience was a major hurdle. Managing asset transfers, wallet interactions, and logic validation across different chains introduced architectural and UX challenges.\nSolution: We implemented modular cross-chain logic using standard token protocols and abstracted complex operations behind a clean UI, ensuring a smooth experience for the user.\n\nEnsuring Prediction Integrity\nA key challenge was safeguarding against manipulation, fake accounts, and sybil attacks in a trustless environment.\nSolution: We added a reputation mechanism and staked participation model to ensure that users had skin in the game. We also incorporated lightweight identity signals to prevent abuse without compromising privacy.\n\nSimplifying Onboarding for Non-Web3 Users\nMany users unfamiliar with blockchain tools found wallet setups and bridging intimidating.\nSolution: We integrated a social login and single-wallet onboarding system to lower the entry barrier and minimize user drop-off.\n\nReal-Time Outcome Verification\nAccurate and timely resolution of prediction markets\u2014especially for real-world events\u2014was a challenge, due to reliance on oracles and external data feeds.\nSolution: We used trusted oracle services and created fallback mechanisms for community-based dispute resolution when data was unclear or delayed.\n\nTime Constraints at the Hackathon\nBuilding a working cross-chain MVP within 48 hours was extremely ambitious.\nSolution: We prioritized core functionalities\u2014prediction creation, staking, and resolution\u2014and focused on a clean demo flow with partial backend integration for less critical features."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nRENTIFY - Revolutionizing Digital Rentals\nHey there! Welcome to the Rentify project - a game-changer in how we access premium digital tools. We built this specially to solve a real problem we all face.\n\nThe Big Idea\nLook, we've all been there. You need Adobe Photoshop for just one project. Or maybe you want to try that expensive AI tool everyone's talking about. But dropping hundreds of dollars for something you'll use occasionally? That hurts.\n\nThat's where Rentify comes in. We're not your typical rental platform - we're smarter. Rentify connects people who aren't currently using their software accounts with people who need temporary access at rock-bottom prices.\n\nThink about it - how many subscription accounts sit idle for weeks or months? With Rentify, account owners can list their unused time and make back some cash, while others get premium tools at a fraction of the regular cost. It's a win-win!\n\nHow It Works\nRentify's pretty straightforward:\n\nFor account owners: Not using your premium software for a while? List your account's available time on Rentify and set your price\nFor users: Browse available accounts by category - Creative Software, AI Tools, Digital Assets, Gaming and more\nChoose what you need - Access premium accounts for days or weeks at incredibly low prices\nInstant access - After payment, you'll get immediate access to the account credentials\nUse & create - That's it! Return the account when you're done\nOur platform ensures smooth handoffs and clear usage terms, with automatic notifications when the rental period is ending. The streaming-style interface makes discovering available accounts as easy as finding your next binge-worthy show.\n\nSecurity That Actually Works\nSecurity isn't just a feature for us - it's our foundation. Here's how we keep everything locked down:\n\nEnd-to-end encryption for all transactions and personal data\nSecure credential management with automatic password resets after rentals\nMulti-factor authentication to protect all accounts\nTokenized payment processing that never stores your full card details\nRegular security audits by independent cybersecurity firms\nWe've built everything using modern web security practices with robust server-side validation and protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF attacks.\n\nFighting Digital Piracy\nLet's talk straight - software piracy hurts everyone. It hurts developers who pour their hearts into creating amazing tools. It hurts legitimate users who end up paying more. And honestly, it hurts pirates too - with malware risks, no support, and the constant worry about legal issues.\n\nRentify offers a better way. We've created an affordable, legitimate alternative that:\n\nMakes use of accounts that would otherwise sit idle\nProvides users with safe, fully-functional software at prices anyone can afford\nIncludes proper support and community help\nEliminates legal and security risks of pirated software\nBy making premium tools accessible at fair prices, we're addressing the root cause of piracy - not just treating the symptoms.\n\nReady to transform how you access digital tools? Join us at Rentify and discover a smarter way to create.\n\nGet Started\nClone the repo\nOpen index.html in your browser\nExplore the future of digital rentals\nBuilt with passion by the Rentify team for Base Batch hackathon\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udd10 1. Security & Credential Management\nChallenge: Securely sharing login credentials without exposing sensitive info.\n\nSolution: You tackled this with end-to-end encryption, automatic password resets, and multi-factor authentication.\n\nOngoing Risk: Preventing misuse or multiple concurrent logins during rentals.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f 2. Legal & Licensing Concerns\nChallenge: Many software licenses explicitly forbid account sharing or subleasing.\n\nSolution: Framing Rentify as a \"time-share\" style access model that doesn\u2019t alter or resell software, just connects idle time.\n\nOngoing Risk: Ensuring compliance with software terms of service to avoid platform takedown or lawsuits.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 3. Trust & Platform Integrity\nChallenge: Making users trust that rented accounts are legit, not banned, or compromised.\n\nSolution: Reputation systems, verified listings, secure transitions, and password resets after each rental.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f 4. Technical Implementation\nChallenge: Managing rental time windows, scheduling, auto-notifications, and credential delivery in real time.\n\nSolution: Likely required a custom backend with timers, notifications, and credential obfuscation or vault-like storage.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 5. UX for a New Concept\nChallenge: Designing a UI that explains a new rental concept clearly and feels as seamless as Netflix or Spotify.\n\nSolution: \u201cStreaming-style\u201d account browsing with easy access flows and categorization.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 6. Payment & Refund Systems\nChallenge: Handling small-time, peer-to-peer rentals securely without storing sensitive financial info.\n\nSolution: Tokenized payments with zero card data storage, probably using third-party processors like Stripe or Razorpay.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 7. Preventing Abuse or Exploits\nChallenge: Renters misusing accounts, changing passwords, using after expiration, or violating ToS.\n\nSolution: Smart monitoring, automated resets, clear usage policies, and maybe limited permissions."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nMillions of Indians hold crypto assets, but using them for everyday transactions remains painfully difficult. Existing solutions require multiple steps\u2014off-ramping to INR, waiting for bank settlements, and manually paying via UPI. This process can take hours or even days, is error-prone, and often comes with high fees or compliance risks.\n\nValut solves this by letting users pay with stablecoins (like USDC) directly at any UPI-enabled merchant. With one simple flow\u2014Scan, Select, Pay\u2014users scan a merchant\u2019s existing UPI QR code, select a stablecoin, and the merchant receives INR instantly via UPI. Merchants don\u2019t need to know or interact with crypto at all.\n\nUnlike competitors who require merchants to adopt new systems or apps, Valut is plug-and-play for end users, instantly compatible with 200M+ existing UPI endpoints in India. This improves usability, shortens transaction time to seconds, and brings real-world utility to crypto in India for the first time.\n\nHow it works:\n- The user scans any UPI QR code using the Valut app or browser extension.\n- Valut decodes the UPI payment info and generates an INR quote in USDC or other supported stablecoins.\n- The user confirms the transaction and pays via their crypto wallet.\n- Valut's backend swaps the stablecoin into INR through a compliant partner, then instantly pushes the INR to the merchant via UPI.\n- The merchant sees a standard UPI payment\u2014no additional steps or crypto knowledge needed.\n\nValut makes crypto spending as seamless as using a bank card, while maintaining compliance and real-time settlement.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was gaining access to PSP (Payment Service Provider) APIs for programmatic INR payouts. Most Indian PSPs don\u2019t allow crypto-related platforms to use their payout APIs, which blocked us from automating UPI transfers initially.\n\nTo work around this, we manually initiated UPI payouts for a small set of users through internal tools to validate the flow and gather early feedback.\n\nWhile building toward automation, we also had to design a transaction tracking system. we architected a hybrid solution using Etherscan APIs and The Graph to monitor wallet activity and token transfers. This helped us accurately track pending, successful, and failed transactions across both on-chain and fiat layers, ensuring transparency and reliability in the settlement process."

No more fake resumes-your skills are verified, portable, and yours forever. It's built for 5M+ engineering students to prove skills globally.\n\nAce DSA solves these big problems in tech learning and hiring:\n\n1) Learning Progress Can Be Manipulated or Lost\nCentralized platforms control leaderboards and progress data. For example, CodeChef once reset user ratings, making hard-earned progress vanish overnight.\n\n2) Users Don\u2019t Truly Own Their Achievements\nPlatforms like LeetCode and CodeChef lock your streaks, badges, and rankings within their apps. You can\u2019t carry or prove your progress outside their ecosystem.\n\n3) Generic Leaderboards Ignore Personal Learning Needs\nOne-size-fits-all rankings push users to chase easy wins instead of improving weak areas, leading to unbalanced skill development.\n\n4) Grinding Is Rewarded More Than Real Learning\nDaily streaks and badges often reward repetition, not actual understanding\u2014causing burnout and shallow practice.\n\n5) Hard to Stay Consistent Without the Right Support\nMany learners struggle with regular DSA practice because most platforms don\u2019t motivate or adapt to individual learning journeys.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was integrating onchain actions with real-time user activity. We needed the AI agent to not only personalize daily DSA challenges but also reliably trigger the minting of NFT badges when users completed them. Ensuring this process was seamless, secure, and gas-efficient took a lot of iteration."

There\u2019s no seamless way to track, pay, or verify payments \u2014 users still need to pay via separate apps like Paytm, Venmo, or UPI.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f Lack of Onchain Transparency\nCurrent apps don\u2019t offer onchain tracking. There's no transparent, immutable ledger showing who paid what, when, or how. This creates trust issues and confusion within friend groups.\n\n\u23f3 Pay Later but Trust Issues\n\"Pay Later\" agreements often rely on personal trust, with no real system to ensure someone will pay. Friends become uncomfortable asking for repayments.\n\n\ud83e\uddfe No Escrow or IOU Security\nExisting platforms lack secure, automated escrow mechanisms. There\u2019s no way to lock funds in a smart contract and enforce repayment obligations onchain.\n\n\ud83d\udcac No Social Accountability\nSocial pressure and gamification can motivate people to pay promptly \u2014 but current platforms do nothing to encourage good behavior. There's no way to make repayments visible or \u201ccool\u201d in a social setting.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Integrating WalletConnect with Frames/MiniKit\nOne of the biggest technical challenges was integrating WalletConnect functionality smoothly within a Farcaster Frame and MiniKit context. Managing session persistence and ensuring secure connections across different environments (web, mobile) was non-trivial.\n\n\ud83d\udcdc Smart Contract Design for IOUs & Escrow\nDesigning smart contracts that fairly represent IOUs and allow \u201cPay Later\u201d logic required thoughtful architecture. Ensuring they were gas-efficient, secure, and allowed both parties to settle or dispute required iteration and testing.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 UX for Onchain Interactions\nTranslating complex blockchain actions like signing, escrowing, and splitting into a user-friendly UI inside Frames was tricky. Many users are new to web3, so creating a seamless flow without confusing the user was a key challenge.\n\n\ud83e\uddea Farcaster Frame Constraints\nFarcaster Frames have limited interactivity compared to full dApps. Balancing what could be done inside a Frame vs. redirecting to a full page for payment flow required trade-offs and creative decisions.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Stablecoin Payment Flow\nImplementing Base USDC payments with proper fallback handling (e.g., insufficient balance, gas estimation) required real-time feedback to users and solid wallet integration logic.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security Considerations\nHandling user funds \u2014 even in escrow \u2014 demanded careful contract auditing, replay protection, and making sure users couldn\u2019t spoof payment status or skip repayments.\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Time Management & Coordination\nManaging smart contract deployment, UI/UX design, wallet integrations, and social logic within a short timeframe (hackathon or sprint) meant rapid prototyping and prioritizing core features."

Our mission is to empower creators to foster creativity and community engagement through gamified experiences, ultimately driving the growth of digital content creation.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building the MemeCoin Battle web app, several challenges emerged across technical, blockchain, and user experience domains. Implementing real-time game mechanics where users vote in 1-minute rounds required precise state synchronization, minimal latency, and scalable vote tallying, which was particularly challenging with concurrent participants. Launching the winning meme as an onchain token on the Base chain introduced further complexity ensuring secure, seamless deployment, unique tickers, and integrated tokenomics without disrupting the user experience. The credit-based voting system added another layer of difficulty, as it had to prevent spam and manipulation while allowing flexible participation and post-launch chat rooms demanded consistent identity handling and smooth data sync across decentralized systems. On the blockchain side, managing liquidity for newly launched tokens and fairly distributing presale allocations to creators and players required well-designed, trustless mechanisms. Preventing pump-and-dump behavior was also critical, necessitating tokenomics that incentivized long-term holding and community engagement through daily tasks and active participation in post-launch chat rooms."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nLegacy-Onchain, currently under development, solves the problem of securely and seamlessly transferring digital assets after death, a growing concern in the digital age where assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and personal media lack clear inheritance mechanisms. Traditional estate planning often overlooks digital holdings, leaving heirs unable to access or claim them due to lost keys or unclear instructions. Legacy-Onchain empowers users to create a digital virasat by storing funds, NFTs, or videos in a blockchain-based vault, designating heirs, and crafting genie-inspired NFTs that unlock only upon the owner\u2019s verified passing. This ensures privacy, security, and a magical, user-friendly experience, bridging the gap between digital wealth and posthumous legacy\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nAs Legacy-Onchain is under development, several challenges have emerged:\n\n\nDeath Verification: Reliably verifying a user\u2019s passing without compromising privacy is complex. We\u2019re exploring decentralized oracles and trusted third-party APIs to securely confirm death certificates or legal documents on-chain, ensuring NFTs unlock only when conditions are met.\n\n\n\nSmart Contract Security: Ensuring the immutability and safety of smart contracts for asset storage and NFT unlocking is critical. We\u2019re conducting rigorous audits and using frameworks like Hardhat to test for vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nUser Experience: Balancing a mystical, genie-themed UI with intuitive functionality for non-technical users is tricky. We\u2019re iterating on designs to make asset uploads, heir designation, and NFT customization enchanting yet simple.\n\n\n\nScalability: Handling large volumes of assets (e.g., high-resolution videos) on IPFS and Ethereum-compatible blockchains can be costly. We\u2019re optimizing storage with compression and exploring layer-2 solutions like Polygon for cost-efficiency.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Compliance: Navigating global laws on digital inheritance and cryptocurrency transfers is challenging. We\u2019re consulting legal experts to ensure compliance with data protection and estate laws.\n\nThese challenges are being tackled through iterative development, community feedback, and partnerships with blockchain and legal experts to make Legacy-Onchain a robust, magical platform."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nKlyro is a builder discovery and scoring platform designed to help hackathon organizers, Web3 communities, and airdrop teams find real builders with verifiable proof of work\u2014all in one place.\n\nWe started with a simple idea: there\u2019s no easy way to discover actual contributors in Web3. GitHub alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, and wallet activity without context is just noise. So we built Klyro to bridge that gap.\n\nWith Klyro, **organizers can spin up customizable registration forms**\u2014just like Google Forms\u2014but instead of collecting just names and emails, they ask for a GitHub handle and wallet address. Once a participant submits, Klyro automatically **analyzes their full builder footprint**.\n\nWe go beyond surface-level tracking. Klyro pulls together data from multiple sources and deeply analyzes:\n\n- Open source Web3 contributions  \n- Active smart contracts they\u2019ve deployed  \n- TVL in those contracts  \n- Number of unique users interacting with their work  \n- GitHub code activity and engagement  \n- Code quality and Lines of code written\n- Hackathons they\u2019ve participated in or won  \n- Overall project ecosystem contributions  \n\nAll this happens across multiple chains, which organizers can filter too!!!\n\nFrom all of this, we generate a comprehensive builder score and a shareable on-chain resume that showcases the builder\u2019s real skills and achievements\u2014backed by verifiable, public data.\n\nThis score isn\u2019t inflated or gamified. **We\u2019ve intentionally designed the scoring to be rigorous, rewarding impact over vanity**. Builders who ship real code, deploy live contracts, and solve meaningful problems get recognized.\n\nOn the organizer\u2019s side, Klyro makes it incredibly simple to:\n\n- View rich, ranked profiles of all applicants  \n- Filter and shortlist based on real data  \n- Send automated acceptance or rejection emails  \n- Export data or plug into your workflows  \n\nNo more spending hours manually vetting GitHub profiles or checking if wallets are real. Klyro does it all\u2014instantly.\n\nWe launched just yesterday and have already onboarded 100+ builders in less than 24 hours, all organic.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\n**We\u2019re expanding Klyro beyond just developers**. Next up: scoring systems for Web3 marketers and creators\u2014people who grow communities, create content, drive adoption, and contribute in non-technical but equally vital ways.\n\nOur vision is to become the talent layer for Web3\u2014a unified, verifiable, and trusted platform where anyone can showcase their work, and any community or project can discover the right contributors with proof, not promises.\n\n**With Klyro, communities can grow smarter, airdrops can be fairer, and builders finally get the recognition they deserve**.\n\nWe also have a Farcaster mini app https://miniapp.klyro.dev/\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Challenges I Ran Into:\n\n- Data Normalization: Aggregating and standardizing diverse data from GitHub, various chains, and protocols was complex due to inconsistent formats.\n\n- On-chain Attribution: Linking contracts to specific builders reliably, especially when deployments weren\u2019t tied directly to ENS or known wallets.\n\n- Scoring Logic: Designing a fair, transparent scoring system that balances quality and quantity across GitHub and on-chain contributions.\n\n- Spam Prevention: Ensuring the form system isn't abused with fake or low-quality submissions without manual review."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n1. Problem Statement\n\nIn today\u2019s digital world, traditional file sharing methods (emails, cloud storage, messaging apps) leave permanent traces that are vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized sharing, and long-term access. Individuals and businesses alike face growing risks due to overexposed documents, leaked credentials, and compliance failures.\n\n2.  Solution\n\nTransFilex provides a zero-footprint solution for sharing files securely and temporarily. Our platform eliminates the risks associated with traditional file transfers by focusing on privacy-first design principles. Files are protected with military-grade encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access them. Users can set custom expiration settings, such as deleting a file after one view or within a set time frame (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days).\n\nWe also offer one-time access links to prevent files from being shared beyond the original recipient. With no login required, users enjoy a frictionless experience that preserves anonymity and removes the need for account management or credential storage. Once accessed or expired, files are automatically deleted from our servers \u2014 leaving no trace behind.\n\nTransFilex empowers users to take control of their data, protect their sensitive information, and maintain compliance without compromising on speed or ease of use. Whether it's a legal contract, a personal document, or internal business data, TransFilex ensures that it is shared safely and disappears by design.\n\n3. Market Demand\n\nWith data privacy laws tightening (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), and cyberattacks on the rise, users and companies are seeking safer, smarter ways to share files. Privacy-first tools are becoming essential, not optional.\n\n4. Core Offerings\n\nSelf-Destructing Files: Auto-delete after time or view.\nEnd-to-End Encryption: Military-grade, secure file transfer.\nLink Access Controls: Expiration timers, download limits.\nNo Account Required: Anonymous sharing for ease and speed.\nFile Analytics (Optional): View access logs and notifications.\n\n5. Target Audience\n\nFreelancers & Agencies (sharing assets, passwords)\nLawyers & Legal Teams (NDAs, contracts)\nHR Departments (onboarding docs, IDs)\nFinance Professionals (reports, statements)\nPrivacy-Conscious Individuals (photos, personal info)\n\nWhy should i select this project?\n\nTransFilex isn\u2019t just another file sharing platform. It's the only mainstream tool focused on ephemeral file delivery. We prioritize deletion, not storage \u2014 giving users total control, with no trace left behind.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDuring the development of our secure ephemeral file sharing application, we encountered several significant challenges:\n\n1.  ** PDF Rendering and Performance**\nChallenge: Implementing a robust PDF viewer that could handle large files while maintaining smooth performance was challenging. The initial implementation struggled with memory management and rendering speed. \n\n2.  ** Secure File Handling**\nChallenge: Ensuring secure file uploads and downloads while maintaining user privacy and data integrity. \n\n3.  **User Experience with File Expiry**\nChallenge: Managing file expiration times and communicating this to users in a clear way. \n\n4. **Share Link Management**\nChallenge: Creating a secure and user-friendly way to generate and manage share links. \n\n5.  **State Management and Data Flow**\nChallenge: Managing complex state **between file upload, viewing, and sharing components. \n**\n6. **Responsive Design**\nChallenge: Ensuring the application works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nImagine this: you wake up one morning with the wildest, most magical dream in your head\u2014a flying unicorn picnic on a cloud, or maybe a pirate adventure in a candy-coated sea!  You\u2019re buzzing with excitement to share it, but as the day goes on, poof\u2014the details start slipping away like a sneaky dream thief! Worse, even if you manage to scribble it down, it just sits in your notebook, gathering dust. You think, \u201cIf only there was a way to not just save my dreams, but turn them into something super cool that I could share with the world!\u201d \n\nDreamScape swoops in like a superhero with a sparkly cape to save the day! Here\u2019s how it tackles the problem in a fun way:\n\nCatches Your Dreams Before They Fly Away:\nWith DreamScape, you can record your dreams right when you wake up\u2014whether it\u2019s a wild adventure or a quirky little story. No more \u201cOh no, I forgot the part where I rode a dragon!\u201d moments. The platform makes it super easy to jot down every detail, so your dreams are safe and sound.\n\nTurns Dreams into Digital Magic:\nHere\u2019s where the real fun begins! DreamScape lets you mint your dreams as digital collectibles (think of them as shiny NFTs\u2014Non-Fungible Tokens\u2014that are one-of-a-kind). It\u2019s like taking your dream of a glittery unicorn and turning it into a magical digital sticker that\u2019s yours forever! You can even add visuals or designs to make it extra special.\n\nShows Off Your Dreamy Creations in a Gallery:\nDreamScape doesn\u2019t stop at saving your dreams\u2014it lets you show them off! Imagine walking through a virtual museum filled with everyone\u2019s wildest dreams\u2014yours included! It\u2019s a place to share, get inspired, and maybe even trade or sell your dream collectibles.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDeveloping DreamScape has been a rewarding yet complex journey. From technical hurdles to user experience considerations, I\u2019ve faced several challenges that have tested my skills and determination. Here\u2019s a detailed look at the obstacles I\u2019ve navigated so far:\n\nOne of the first hurdles I encountered was getting the GallerySection to render correctly. I designed it to display three 400x300 placeholders to represent future dreams, but they weren\u2019t showing up as expected. After some investigation, I discovered the issue: my styles/globals.css file was empty, meaning Tailwind CSS wasn\u2019t generating the necessary styles (like w-[400px] and bg-gray-300).\n\nA core feature of DreamScape is allowing users to mint their dreams as NFTs, but I quickly realized this could be daunting for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. The \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in my NavigationBar is a starting point, but the minting process involves complex steps like wallet connections, smart contract interactions, and understanding gas fees.\n\nDreamScape requires a backend to store dream data and handle NFT minting, likely using an API (referenced by NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL in my .env). However, integrating the frontend with a backend has proven challenging.\n\nDreamScape\u2019s concept\u2014recording and minting dreams as NFTs\u2014is unique, but it might be unfamiliar to many users, especially those new to blockchain technology. I want users to feel excited and confident using the platform, not confused or hesitant.\n\nDreamScape is a passion project that combines creativity and technology, and I\u2019m excited to see it evolve."

This minimizes risk for supporters and aligns incentives between builders and backers. By combining direct investment and staking options, OneHaus creates a more secure, transparent, and community-driven funding ecosystem, improving both capital efficiency and project reliability in the Web3 space.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the major challenges I faced was setting up IPFS metadata for project submissions.

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nAgentConnect tackles the challenge of enabling truly autonomous AI agents to collaborate effectively and securely in a decentralized manner. Current multi-agent systems often rely on centralized control, hard-coded connections, and lack native support for economic interactions.\n\nAgentConnect improves upon this by providing a framework where:\n\n*   **Decentralized Discovery:** Agents can dynamically discover each other based on advertised capabilities and rich profiles through a decentralized ***AgentRegistry***, rather than relying on pre-configured links. This fosters a more flexible and scalable \"living ecosystem\" of agents.\n*   **Secure Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication:** Interactions are secured with cryptographic identities and signed messages, ensuring trust and data integrity without a central intermediary.\n*   **True Autonomy & Interoperability:** Each agent operates independently with its own logic and can be built with different underlying technologies, promoting a heterogeneous yet interconnected network.\n*   **Integrated Agent Economy:** AgentConnect seamlessly integrates with Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) and AgentKit, allowing agents to autonomously offer services for onchain payment (e.g., USDC on Base), request services, and settle transactions. This facilitates the creation of sophisticated, self-sustaining agent-driven workflows and economies.\n*   **Reduced Complexity:** It abstracts away the complexities of secure communication, service discovery, and onchain payments, allowing developers to focus on building agent capabilities.\n\nIn essence, AgentConnect aims to provide the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of collaborative AI, moving beyond siloed systems to a dynamic network of specialized, value-exchanging autonomous agents.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDeveloping AgentConnect involved tackling several inherent complexities of decentralized autonomous systems:\n\n*   **Challenge: Ensuring Secure and Verifiable Agent Interactions.**\n    *   **Problem:** In a decentralized network where agents can join dynamically, establishing trust and ensuring that communication is authentic and tamper-proof is paramount.\n    *   **Solution:** We implemented a robust ***AgentIdentity*** system using cryptographic key pairs (DIDs, public/private keys). All agent-to-agent messages are signed and verified, preventing impersonation and ensuring message integrity. The ***CommunicationHub*** leverages these identities for secure routing.\n\n*   **Challenge: Enabling Dynamic and Flexible Agent Discovery.**\n    *   **Problem:** Agents need to find other agents that offer specific capabilities without prior hard-coded knowledge. This discovery needs to be efficient and support rich queries.\n    *   **Solution:** We designed an ***AgentRegistry*** where agents publish detailed ***AgentProfiles*** outlining their identity, capabilities, skills, and even cost for services. This allows for semantic searching and dynamic discovery, enabling agents to find the most suitable collaborators on-demand.\n\n*   **Challenge: Integrating Secure and Autonomous On-Chain Payments.**\n    *   **Problem:** To create a true agent economy, agents need to be able to pay each other for services autonomously and securely using onchain assets. This involves managing wallets, signing transactions, and verifying payments within the agent's operational loop.\n    *   **Solution:** We integrated Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) and AgentKit. This allows agents to have their own wallets, advertise services with costs (e.g., in USDC on Base Sepolia, as shown in our demo), and for AI agents to autonomously decide to make payments using LLM-driven tool usage. The framework handles the underlying transaction mechanics.\n\n*   **Challenge: Designing for True Agent Autonomy alongside Effective Collaboration.**\n    *   **Problem:** The system needed to allow agents to operate independently, making their own decisions, while still providing the mechanisms for them to collaborate effectively towards shared goals without a central orchestrator dictating their actions.\n    *   **Solution:** AgentConnect's architecture, with its decoupled ***CommunicationHub*** (for message routing) and ***AgentRegistry*** (for discovery), allows individual agents to encapsulate their own logic and decision-making processes. Collaboration emerges from agents discovering and choosing to interact with each other based on their individual goals and advertised capabilities."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nThe current warranty system is broken both from a technical and user experience perspective. As developers, we deal with fragmented data across retailers, manufacturers, and support systems, making it hard to build unified, verifiable ownership or warranty logic. There is no shared standard to track warranties or purchases, which leads to complexity in integration and verification. For users, this means lost receipts, unregistered products, and rejected warranty claims. Brands face challenges like warranty fraud, lack of insights into product usage after sale, and missed opportunities to build loyalty. In real-world scenarios, secondhand buyers can't prove ownership, support teams struggle to validate claims, and no one has a reliable, cross-platform way to manage post-purchase value.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building this system, one of the main challenges was creating a unified warranty layer that works seamlessly across on-chain and off-chain flows. Handling NFT minting with dynamic metadata, while keeping the process gas-efficient and secure, required precise smart contract design and event handling. Another issue was building a backend that could validate ownership and warranty logic without relying solely on blockchain reads, to ensure performance and scalability. On the real-world side, verifying sellers and preventing fake or unauthorized warranty registrations was tricky, especially in a decentralized setup. We also had to account for expired warranties, resale cases, and delayed claims, all while maintaining a user-friendly experience. Balancing technical complexity with usability across wallets, IPFS, and smart wallets added significant friction during implementation."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**The Problem It Solves:**\n\nTraditional blood bank systems often lack transparency, traceability, and data security. There\u2019s no reliable way to track a blood unit from donor to recipient, and records are prone to human error or manipulation. This can lead to misuse, over-donation, expired blood usage, and trust issues between donors, hospitals, and regulators.\n\n**How My Project Solves It:**\n\nMy project, BloodChain, uses blockchain to store and manage blood donation records securely and transparently. Each blood unit is recorded immutably on the blockchain, making its lifecycle\u2014from donation to usage\u2014fully traceable. Hospitals, donors, and authorities can verify data without relying on a central authority. This reduces fraud, ensures accountability, and builds a more trustworthy blood management system.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Challenges I Ran Into:**\n\nOne major challenge was integrating the smart contract with the frontend. Initially, React couldn\u2019t recognize blockchain methods due to mismatched ABI or contract address errors. I also faced version conflicts with libraries like web3 and qrcode.react, which caused the app to crash or fail to compile.\n\nAnother issue was local development setup especially on Windows where script execution policies and missing modules like react-scripts blocked the app from running. Troubleshooting these errors and manually configuring project files was time-consuming.\n\n**How I Overcame It:**\n\nI carefully debugged each error step-by-step, ensured my ABI matched the contract, used the legacy-peer-deps flag to handle version issues, and restructured the React project with all required files like index.html and index.js. I also replaced deprecated imports (like QRCode) with updated ones (QRCodeSVG) to match the latest package versions.\n\nThrough this process, I learned to be more efficient at reading error logs and understanding how the frontend and blockchain communicate."

Independent artists, in particular, face several persistent issues:\n\nOpaque Revenue Sharing: Contracts are often complex and lack transparency, with hidden clauses and unfavorable terms that reduce artists' earnings.\n\nDelayed or Withheld Payments: Payment cycles are slow and subject to manipulation, with artists frequently waiting months to receive what they\u2019re owed.\n\nScams and Fraudulent Labels: With no verifiable on-chain identity, many so-called \"labels\" exploit artists with fake promises or predatory terms.\n\nLimited Fan Engagement: Artists struggle to raise funds directly from fans without giving away a large portion of revenue to intermediaries or platforms.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Designing Trustless Music Contracts\nOne of the most complex challenges was architecting smart contracts that could reflect the nuances of music deals\u2014such as revenue splits, milestones, and deliverables\u2014while maintaining simplicity and security. Traditional music agreements are full of edge cases and legal jargon, so translating that into deterministic smart contract logic required significant abstraction.\n\nHow we overcame it:\nWe broke down real-world contracts into modular components (e.g., payment triggers, ownership rights, milestone conditions) and modeled each as atomic, reusable smart contract functions. We then encapsulated these components into a single NFT-backed contract per deal, improving usability while maintaining flexibility.\n\n2. Ensuring Secure and Instant Payments\nImplementing escrow-based, milestone-triggered payments in a secure and gas-efficient way was challenging. Incorrect logic could lead to lost funds, failed releases, or unfair distribution.\n\nHow we overcame it:\nWe used rigorous testing and formal design patterns to build our escrow system. Edge cases such as reentrancy, incorrect milestone triggers, or contract self-destruction were mitigated by following OpenZeppelin\u2019s battle-tested libraries and running test suites across both Sepolia and Base testnets.\n\n3. On-Chain Reputation System\nCreating a reputation system that could accurately reflect a label or artist\u2019s credibility based on on-chain activity\u2014without being susceptible to manipulation or spam\u2014was non-trivial.\n\nHow we overcame it:\nWe implemented a scoring mechanism that considers verified transaction history, deal completion rates, and timeliness of payments. We avoided subjective metrics and instead relied on cryptographic evidence available on-chain (e.g., deal hashes, contract execution times, wallet verification)."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nTraditional online games and auction platforms often lack transparency, true ownership, and strategic personalization. Users can\u2019t verify fairness, and assets are usually stored in centralized systems with no real value outside the game.\n\nBID-ION solves this by combining:\n\nAI for smarter, adaptive gameplay,\n\nBlockchain (Monad) for transparency, decentralization, and real NFT ownership,\n\nAnd real-time auctions with strategic card battles that reward skill and decision-making.\n\nIt transforms static, luck-based games into intelligent, trustless ecosystems where users truly own and control their digital assets.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nChallenges We Ran Into\nWhile building MonadAuction, we encountered several challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and technical knowledge:\n\nSmart Contract Integration: One of the biggest hurdles was ensuring smooth integration between the frontend and the deployed smart contracts on the Monad blockchain. Handling transactions securely and making sure the contract execution was error-free on the testnet required careful attention to gas optimization and transaction validation.\n\nHow We Overcame It: We utilized Ether.js to manage the connection between the smart contract and the frontend. By leveraging Ether.js' functionality to estimate gas and handle transactions securely, we were able to ensure that every interaction with the smart contract was seamless. Extensive testing on the testnet allowed us to debug issues and optimize for efficiency.\n\nAI Bidding Agents: Implementing AI-driven bidding agents that could place bids autonomously in real-time posed both technical and strategic challenges. We had to ensure the agents were making intelligent, competitive bids while adhering to predefined strategies without interfering with user bids.\n\nHow We Overcame It: We designed a basic machine learning model to simulate competitive bidding strategies, adjusting parameters like bid amounts and timings. After fine-tuning the model, we integrated it into the bidding process to ensure it interacted seamlessly with the auction mechanics.\n\nReal-Time Auction Updates: Ensuring real-time updates of auction statuses and bid placements for a large number of users proved difficult due to latency and synchronization issues between the frontend and backend.\n\nHow We Overcame It: We employed WebSockets to implement real-time data streaming, ensuring that updates to bids, auction timers, and notifications were instant and synchronized across all users, providing a smooth user experience."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n\ud83d\udd27 The Problem It Solves:\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 1. Smart Contracts Lack Contextual Intelligence\nTraditional smart contracts are rigid and rule-based. They require all conditions to be predefined and static. For example, a contract might say, \u201cIf ETH > $3,000, then sell\u201d, but it lacks understanding of the broader market context\u2014like volatility, volume shifts, or upcoming economic events. This leads to poor decision-making, missed opportunities, or unnecessary transactions.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 2. Oracles Provide Raw Data, Not Decisions\nBlockchain applications often rely on oracles (like Chainlink) to bring off-chain data on-chain. While these oracles provide price feeds, news, or weather data, they don\u2019t interpret or act on the data. The burden of logic still falls on the developer, and that logic is often hardcoded and limited.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f 3. No Seamless Integration Between AI & Blockchain\nWhile AI and blockchain are powerful individually, few platforms seamlessly combine them. Most AI applications operate off-chain, while smart contracts stay on-chain, with little to no meaningful interaction. There's a missing bridge that allows real-time AI decisions to directly trigger onchain actions securely and autonomously.\n\n\u2705 How CognitoSign Solves This\n\u2705 1. AI-Enhanced Smart Contract Agents\nCognitoSign introduces AI-powered autonomous agents that can analyze real-world data through Google\u2019s Gemini AI, make intelligent decisions, and then trigger smart contract actions on the Base blockchain. This enables smart contracts that are context-aware, adaptive, and dynamic.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIf ETH shows signs of true market volatility (not just a spike), an agent may purchase insurance automatically.\n\nIf a verified disaster event is detected, it can automatically donate crypto to relief efforts.\n\n\u2705 2. Custom Triggers & Real-World Relevance\nUsers can define custom conditions and actions, but instead of just relying on binary thresholds, CognitoSign uses AI to interpret inputs:\n\nIs the event confirmed?\n\nIs the market truly unstable?\n\nIs there enough confidence to act?\n\nThis solves the problem of over-simplified logic in smart contracts.\n\n\u2705 3. Transparent, Trustworthy Execution\nAll AI decisions are:\n\nAuditable (you can view the reasoning)\n\nOnchain recorded (actions are verified and immutable)\n\nDashboard-accessible (track every agent, every decision)\n\nThis bridges the AI \u2192 Decision \u2192 Blockchain Execution pipeline\u2014solving the problem of disconnected systems.\n\n\u2705 4. Base Blockchain for Scalability\nBy building on Base (Ethereum L2), CognitoSign ensures that intelligent agents operate cost-effectively, quickly, and securely, making the solution viable for real-world adoption not just as a demo or concept.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 In Summary\nCognitoSign solves the pressing problem of dumb, inflexible smart contracts by transforming them into autonomous, AI-powered agents. It merges the interpretive power of AI with the execution guarantees of blockchain, creating a new category of decentralized applications that are intelligent, reactive, and practical.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Challenges I Ran Into:\n\n1. Bridging AI and Onchain Logic\nChallenge: One of the most significant hurdles was integrating Gemini AI with smart contract logic in a way that allowed real-time, context-aware decisions to be translated into onchain actions. AI models output natural language or structured JSON, but smart contracts need deterministic, binary triggers.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe created a clear mapping layer where Gemini\u2019s JSON analysis results (like volatility level or event verification status) were parsed into actionable smart contract conditions. We also built fallback rules to ensure determinism when AI output was ambiguous.\n\n2. OnchainKit & Base Blockchain Deployment\nChallenge: Deploying smart contracts on the Base Testnet (and preparing for Base Mainnet) required configuring the correct wallet connection, gas management, and contract compilation flow\u2014especially while using OnchainKit for abstraction.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe isolated and modularized all blockchain-related logic using utilities (wallet-connect.tsx, web3.ts, smartContract.ts). We rigorously tested deployments on Base Testnet using MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. We also added support for gas fee limits and network validation to avoid failed deployments.\n\n3. AI Input Validation and Error Handling\nChallenge: Since users provide custom JSON inputs for AI analysis, malformed data could easily break the flow or return poor-quality decisions.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe implemented strict input validation and error-handling checks in the frontend. We also gave users sample JSONs and helpful tooltips to reduce formatting errors. On the backend, the Gemini integration was wrapped with safe fallback responses to handle API errors gracefully.\n\n4. Storing and Monitoring Agent States\nChallenge: Tracking the lifecycle of agents (created \u2192 deployed \u2192 pending \u2192 active) along with their associated contracts and execution logs required a reliable and real-time backend storage model.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe used PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM to maintain clean and normalized records of agents and executions. A real-time dashboard was built to fetch agent status and logs using server-side APIs, ensuring users could always monitor what's happening.\n\n5. Building a Usable yet Technical UI\nChallenge: Designing a frontend that feels approachable to non-technical users but also supports advanced agent configuration (like custom conditions, contract settings, etc.) was tricky.\n\nHow I Overcame It:\nWe used shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS to build a clean, responsive interface. Components like the agent form, dashboard cards, and AI integration page were broken into logical steps with tooltips, defaults, and error messages to make the process intuitive."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# The Problems Milestone Solves  \n\nMilestone tackles systemic failures in civic infrastructure management that plague governments and citizens alike. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the critical pain points:  \n\n---\n\n### **Bureaucratic Black Holes**  \n**Problem**:  Reports vanish into endless emails, spreadsheets, or unmonitored hotlines. Manual triage delays responses for weeks (or months), eroding public trust.  \n\n**Example**:  A citizen reports a pothole, but the request gets buried under paperwork. No one knows who\u2019s responsible, and repairs never happen.  \n\n---\n\n### **Zero Accountability**  \n**Problem**:  No transparency in task assignment, budgeting, or progress tracking. Contractors face no penalties for missed deadlines or subpar work.  \n\n**Example**:  A worker takes payment upfront but delays repairs indefinitely. The city lacks tools to enforce consequences.  \n\n---\n\n### **Privacy Risks**  \n**Problem**:  Citizens fear reporting issues due to exposed personal data (e.g., names, addresses). Governments struggle to verify identities without invasive methods.  \n\n**Example**:  A resident avoids reporting a broken streetlight to avoid spam or retaliation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Slow, Opaque Payments**  \n**Problem**:  Workers wait months for payments due to manual invoicing and approvals. Citizens have no visibility into how tax dollars are spent.  \n\n**Example**:  A contractor fixes a bridge but can\u2019t pay bills while waiting for a check.  \n\n---\n\n### **Crypto Complexity**  \n**Problem**:  Workers and citizens avoid blockchain solutions due to gas fees, wallets, and technical jargon. Governments can\u2019t adopt crypto tools without simplified UX.  \n\n---\n## **1. Citizen Reports an Issue**  \n- **Login**: Citizen authenticates via **Self.xyz\u2019s ZK-proofs**, proving residency without exposing personal data.  \n- **Report**: Types a natural language description (e.g., *\u201cBroken streetlight at Oak Park entrance\u201d*).  \n1. **Self.xyz SDK** generates a zero-knowledge proof to verify the citizen\u2019s residency.  \n2. **AgentKit\u2019s LLM agent** parses the grievance by analysing the image for situation Aware  \n   - Extracts GPS coordinates, issue type (e.g., \"streetlight\"), and severity.  \n   - Auto-generates a task budget and timeline.  \n3. A **smart contract** (deployed on **Base Network**) is created, storing task details onchain.  \n---\n## **2. Task Assignment & Bidding**  \n- **Workers** (contractors) view open tasks in their area and submit bids.  \n1. Task details (budget, deadline, location) are published to a public bidding dashboard.  \n2. **Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs)** enforce rules:  \n   - Penalty clauses (e.g., *\u201cMiss deadline \u2192 lose $20/day\u201d*) are embedded in the contract.  \n   - Bids and worker reputations are stored onchain.  \n---\n## **3. Work Execution & Verification**  \n- **Worker** accepts the task, completes repairs, and submits proof (e.g., photos, IoT sensor data).  \n1. **RSC** pulls cross-chain data (e.g., Base \u2192 React) to update the DAO dashboard and Payments.  \n2. **RSCs** trigger milestone payments via **Sablier streaming** on Base Network on hold and pay basis - funds are realsed only after completion\n---\n## **4. Payment & Transparency**  \n- **Citizen** receives a *\u201cFixed!\u201d* notification with onchain proof.  \n- **Worker** claims payment in ETH via Reactive Network.  \n1. **Base Network** processes instant payments, recorded onchain.  \n2. Funds stream to the worker\u2019s Smart Wallet; penalties (if any) auto-revert to the DAO. \n---\n## **5. DAO Governance** \n- **Citizens** vote on disputes, budget changes, or protocol upgrades.\n1. **RSCs** auto-execute approved decisions.\n---\n# Key Differentiators & Uniqueness\n\n---\n\n## **Core Innovations**\n### 1. **AI-Driven Civic Problem-Solving**\n   - **Predictive Analytics**: Proactively flags issues (e.g., potholes, floods) using IoT sensor data + historical patterns, **before** citizens report them.\n   - **Auto-Verification**: AI (AgentKit) validates work completion via image recognition (e.g., confirming a repaired road), reducing human bias.\n\n### 2. **Reactive Penalty System**\n   - Funds are **automatically redistributed to the community** if workers miss deadlines, enforced by Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs). No existing civic platform penalizes delays trustlessly.\n\n### 3. **Hybrid Voting Mechanism**\n   - Combines **quadratic voting** (community sentiment) with **AI scoring** (objective metrics like repair durability) for fair, balanced assessments.\n\n### 4. **Privacy-Preserving Participation**\n   - Self Protocol\u2019s ZKPs let users prove residency/eligibility **without exposing personal data**\u2014unlike centralized platforms that collect IDs.\n\n### 5. **Cross-Chain DAO Funding**\n   - Accepts donations/payments across chains (ETH, MATIC, BTC) via ZetaChain, enabling global participation in local governance.\n\n---\n## **Improvements Over Similar Projects**\n1. **vs. FixMyStreet (Gov\u2019t Portals)**:\n   - **Transparency**: All workflows (funding, worker assignments) are on-chain.\n   - **Speed**: AI auto-pro\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**AI Misclassification of Civic Issues**\nProblem: The AI layer sometimes misclassified image inputs (e.g., confusing a pothole for a shadow), which led to incorrect task categorization."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Coin Cast** is designed to tackle two pressing challenges within the Web3 ecosystem: **the sustainability of token projects and the monetisation struggles of content creators**. \n\n**1. Token Projects Lose Momentum**\nMany ERC-20 token projects launched on platforms like Clanker and Zora face a common issue: they lose traction shortly after their initial launch. This happens due to:\n**Lack of Ongoing Promotion:** After the hype of a token launch fades, there\u2019s often no mechanism to maintain visibility or interest.\n\n**Insufficient Community Engagement:** Without active participation from supporters, tokens struggle to build a loyal user base.\n\n**No Rewards for Supporters:** Loyal community members who could drive long-term growth aren\u2019t incentivised to stay engaged.\n\nAs a result, these tokens experience declining liquidity, reduced trading volume, and a drop in value, undermining their potential for success.\n\n**2. Content Creators Lack Incentives**\nMicro-creators on platforms like Zora and Farcaster produce valuable content that could amplify token projects, but they face significant hurdles:\n\n**No Direct Connection to Token Projects:** There\u2019s a disconnect between content creators and the token ecosystems they could promote.\n\n**Limited Monetization Options:** Traditional revenue streams like ads or tips are insufficient or inconsistent for many creators.\n\n**Unrewarded Promotion Efforts:** Creators who advocate for token projects don\u2019t receive tangible rewards tied to those projects\u2019 success.\n\nThis misalignment prevents a natural synergy between token creators and content creators, leaving both groups underserved.\n\n**How Coin Cast Addresses These Needs**\nCoin Cast bridges the gap between token creators and content creators, creating a unified ecosystem where aligned incentives drive sustainable growth. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n**A Unified Ecosystem**\n\n**Linking Tokens and Content:** Coin Cast connects parent tokens (e.g., ERC-20 tokens launched on Clanker) with child tokens (e.g., Zora Coins) and content from platforms like Zora and Farcaster. This integration forms a cohesive network where token projects gain visibility through content, and creators gain access to token-based opportunities.\n\n**Seamless Cross-Platform Experience: **By integrating with leading platforms, Coin Cast eliminates the need for users to navigate disconnected systems, enhancing accessibility and usability.\n\n**Incentivised Promotion Through Fee Sharing**\n\n**Fee-Sharing Mechanism:** Token creators can allocate a portion of their trading fees (e.g., from Uniswap V3 pools) or liquidity pool (LP) fees to content creators. These rewards are distributed based on engagement metrics such as:\nMints: When content drives token minting.\n\nTrades: When promotion increases trading volume.\n\nLikes/Recasts: When content boosts social engagement on platforms like Farcaster.\n\n**Direct Rewards:** Unlike platforms relying on indirect monetisation (e.g., ads), Coin Cast uses a transparent, blockchain-based system to ensure creators are fairly compensated for their contributions.\n\n**Sustainable Growth for Token Projects**\n\n**Community-Driven Momentum:** By rewarding content creators and supporters, Coin Cast fosters a thriving community that keeps token projects active and relevant long after launch.\n\n**Enhanced Liquidity and Value:** Continuous promotion by incentivised creators drives trading activity, preserving token value and liquidity over time.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe biggest challenged we faced was testing without real LP fees\n\nChallenge: The biggest challenge was testing the complete flow without an actual LP fee-generating token. Though we had our split and distribution contracts ready, we couldn't verify if they worked properly in real conditions.\n\nSolution: Deployed custom Clanker contracts, created our own liquidity pool, and manually generated LP fees to simulate the entire process and ensure everything was functioning correctly."

One top of that it has become overwhelming enough leading to people tuning it out to save their sanity.\n\nThe solution - Subline\n\n- A contextual news app powered by systems thinking (inspired by \u201cThinking in Systems\u201d by Donella Meadows) + onchain signals.\n\n- Users explore timelines, historical background, key stakeholders, and feedback loops.\n\n- Signal your support for truth onchain \u2014 and see what your community is backing. (v2)\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne key challenge was integrating onchain functionality in a way that felt meaningful within a news-reading experience. I experimented with several models with the help of AI\u2014context sharing, tipping, and onchain posting\u2014before landing on a simple, intuitive tipping system tied to user context for version 1."

Every transaction, every swap, and every balance is public. But for many real users and use cases, this creates friction, exposure, and even risk.\n\nWhile Uniswap v4 unlocks modularity and customization via hooks, it doesn\u2019t natively support confidentiality, especially at the swap level and onchain privacy remains an unsolved problem.\n\n***The Solution: Confidential Swaps via Inco Lightning + Uniswap v4***\n\nThis project enables confidential token swaps on Uniswap v4 using Inco Lightning\u2019s composable privacy layer deployed on Base Sepolia. We leverage Uniswap v4 hooks to seamlessly wrap/unwrap tokens into Confidential ERC20s (cERC20s) during the swap process \u2014 achieving privacy without compromising UX or composability.\n\n***Here\u2019s how it's done:***\n\n- BeforeSwap Hook: The confidential token is unwrapped inside the hook, so the pool sees a standard ERC20 \u2014 fully compatible with Uniswap\u2019s core logic.\n\n- AfterSwap Hook: After the trade is executed, the token is rewrapped into its confidential counterpart, shielding the user's final balance.\n\nUsers interact with the same interfaces and tools they already use, while the privacy logic runs behind the scenes. By bringing seamless confidentiality to token swaps, this product makes DeFi safer, more usable, and more appealing for the next wave of users and developers.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nNo major challenges except setting up the pool with the right wrap/unwrap permissions."

Additionally, most crypto bots focus on **Telegram**, missing the massive user base of **WhatsApp**, which is more widely used globally\u2014especially in regions with limited tech adoption or unstable internet.\n\n### **How BaseLink Improves This**\n\n**BaseLink** solves this by bringing **blockchain functionality directly to WhatsApp**, the world\u2019s most popular messaging platform. Users can **send tokens, swap assets, check crypto prices, and manage blockchain activities** using **simple text commands**\u2014no extra apps, wallets, or technical skills required. Powered by **Uniswap GOAT SDK** and running on **Base Chain**, BaseLink makes DeFi and blockchain services **accessible, intuitive, and available to anyone, anywhere** through a familiar chat interface.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n### **Challenges I Ran Into**\n\n1. **WhatsApp API Limitations**\n   WhatsApp\u2019s official API is designed primarily for customer service, not blockchain transactions. This made integrating real-time, interactive blockchain features complex.\n   **Solution:**\n   We built a custom middleware that translates user-friendly WhatsApp commands into on-chain actions, ensuring both security and usability while staying within API guidelines.\n\n2. **User Security & Transaction Verification**\n   Simplifying crypto commands for WhatsApp raised concerns about accidental or unauthorized transactions.\n   **Solution:**\n   We implemented **two-step confirmations** and **transaction summaries** before execution, ensuring users can verify details before signing or approving any transaction.\n\n3. **Token Routing & Swap Optimization**\n   Finding efficient token swap routes on Base Chain using Uniswap\u2019s liquidity posed technical challenges, especially for lesser-known tokens.\n   **Solution:**\n   By integrating the **Uniswap GOAT SDK**, we automated route discovery and price optimization, providing users with the best available rates without technical overhead."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**[ReTix](https://retix.vercel.app/)** solves the problem of fraud and lack of trust in secondary ticket reselling.\n\nIn traditional ticket marketplaces:\n\t\u2022\tAnyone can list a ticket, even if they don\u2019t actually own it \u2014 leading to fake or duplicate listings.\n\t\u2022\tBuyers have no cryptographic guarantee that the seller will deliver the ticket after payment.\n\t\u2022\tPayments and delivery are not trustless \u2014 they rely on centralized platforms or reputation systems.\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s no proof of delivery \u2014 sellers can claim they sent the ticket, but there\u2019s no verifiable evidence.\n\n**ReTix** addresses all of these issues by introducing cryptographic verification into the resale process:\n\t\u2022\tSellers must prove ticket ownership using Reclaim before they can list.\n\t\u2022\tBuyers\u2019 funds are held in a smart contract escrow \u2014 not controlled by any third party.\n\t\u2022\tAfter sending the ticket via email, sellers submit a zkTLS proof (via Reclaim) that cryptographically confirms the ticket was sent to the buyer\u2019s email address.\n\t\u2022\tOnly after this proof is verified on-chain are funds released to the seller.\n\nIn short, ReTix removes the need for trust, prevents fake listings, and makes delivery verifiable \u2014 all without intermediaries.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nWhile building ReTix, we encountered several key technical challenges:\n\t1.\t**Gmail Doesn\u2019t Support zkTLS**\nGmail doesn\u2019t expose the TLS handshake data required for generating native zkTLS proofs. To overcome this, we built a custom application called [email-verifier](https://github.com/abhishek-mvs/email-verifier) that uses Google OAuth 2.0 to access the seller\u2019s Gmail account (with consent). It reads the first email sent to the buyer and extracts the email content, recipient address, and timestamp.\nWe use this data to construct a zkTLS proof. Then, we created a custom Reclaim provider (Id: **1def9b5a-dcb1-403a-bcb8-3f0360fa97fb**) around this mechanism, allowing sellers to cryptographically prove that the email (containing the ticket) was sent \u2014 without relying on any centralized service.\n\t2.\t**Verifying the Correct Ticket Was Sent**\nIt\u2019s not enough to prove that an email was sent \u2014 we also needed to verify that the correct ticket was delivered.\nWhen a seller lists a ticket, we extract the bookingId and transactionId from the BookMyShow URL and use them to generate an encrypted hash. This hash is stored as part of the ticket\u2019s metadata on-chain. To enable this, we created a custom Reclaim provider (Id: **c35f3209-0062-4dec-a173-955ba8e8f45d**) that interacts with BookMyShow and verifies the seller\u2019s ticket ownership at the time of listing.\nLater, when the seller emails the ticket to the buyer and submits a zkTLS proof (via email-verifier), we parse the email content to extract the URL again, derive the bookingId and transactionId, re-compute the encrypted hash, and compare it with the stored metadata.\nIf the hashes match, we confirm that the correct ticket was sent \u2014 ensuring a fully verifiable, trustless transfer.\n\t3.\t**Escrow Lock Edge Cases**\nIf the seller never sends the ticket or doesn\u2019t complete the proof, the buyer\u2019s funds could remain locked in escrow. We implemented a cron-based timeout mechanism that automatically refunds buyers if the delivery isn\u2019t confirmed within a specific time window.\n\n**Improvements Still Needed**\n\t\u2022\tMulti-Platform Support\nRight now, ReTix only supports BookMyShow tickets. We created a custom Reclaim provider specifically for verifying BookMyShow ownership during ticket listing. To scale, we need to build and integrate additional providers for other platforms like District, Paytm Insider, Ticketmaster, etc.\n\t\u2022\tPreventing Duplicate Ticket Delivery\nSellers could potentially email the same ticket to multiple buyers. One possible solution is to hold funds in escrow until after the event, allowing buyers to dispute invalid tickets. However, verifying whether a buyer was denied entry is still an open problem.\n\t\u2022\tNative Ticket Transfers\nBookMyShow supports official ticket transfers for some events \u2014 generating a fresh QR code for the new user. Where available, we plan to integrate this feature to make ticket delivery fully trustless. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not universally supported across events.\n\t\u2022\tOffline/Physical Ticket Support\nWe don\u2019t yet support offline tickets such as wristbands or printed passes. We\u2019re exploring how to add verifiable delivery via postal or courier services, or NFC tap-based proofs in person."

Furthermore, traditional NFT games require expensive assets, complex onboarding, or offer limited creative freedom to users.\n\nOur project solves these challenges by:\n\nMerging AI-generated creativity with on-chain ownership: Users can generate unique artwork using AI, then mint it as NFTs\u2014giving real value and identity to their creations.\n\nGamifying the experience: Instead of passively holding NFTs, users can enter their AI-generated NFTs into battles within a digital arena, adding competitive and entertainment value to the ownership experience.\n\nLowering the barrier to entry: Through intuitive AI interfaces and seamless minting, even non-technical users can participate in the world of NFTs and Web3 gaming.\n\nEncouraging creativity and personalization: Unlike preset in-game assets, users define their characters through prompts and imagination, making every NFT unique and meaningful.\n\nCreating utility for AI art: Instead of just showcasing AI art, this project gives it a life, purpose, and a way to interact in a larger ecosystem.\n\nBy combining AI, blockchain, and gaming, our platform bridges the gap between passive ownership and interactive digital experiences\u2014making NFTs more accessible, engaging, and useful.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nIntegrating AI image generation with Web3: Connecting an external AI model (like Hugging Face or Stability AI) and formatting its output for minting as an NFT was more complex than expected. Handling file formats, image data conversion, and asynchronous generation required deep coordination between frontend and backend logic.\n\nMinting workflow complexity: Ensuring the minting process remained gas-efficient and user-friendly was challenging. We had to carefully handle wallet connections, image uploads, metadata storage (IPFS or Arweave), and smart contract interactions, all while keeping the UI intuitive."

We built it on the **Base Sepolia testnet**, and it lets you play fun, classic games like **Dice**, **Mines**, and **Plinko** \u2014 all powered by smart contracts.\n\nNo central system, no shady stuff. Every action \u2014 placing bets, deciding outcomes, giving payouts \u2014 runs on-chain. Just connect your wallet and play. It\u2019s transparent, fast, and most importantly, fair.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 What Problem Are We Solving?\n\nWhile trying out some online casino platforms (Web2 and Web3), we realized a few annoying issues:\n\n- \u274c **Can you really trust them?**  \n  Most platforms are centralized. You have no clue what\u2019s happening behind the scenes \u2014 is the game fair? Who knows.\n\n- \u26fd **Gas fees suck.**  \n  On Ethereum mainnet, sometimes the gas fee is more than your actual bet. That just kills the fun.\n\n- \ud83d\udd52 **Slow payouts.**  \n  Even if you win, you\u2019re stuck waiting for your payout. Kinda ruins the vibe.\n\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Too many random tokens.**  \n  Some platforms use weird in-game tokens you have to manage or swap. It\u2019s confusing and totally unnecessary.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 What Makes MetaBet Different?\n\nWe tried to keep things simple, fast, and fair. Here\u2019s what we did differently:\n\n- \u2705 **Everything\u2019s on-chain**  \n  Every bet, win, or payout goes through smart contracts. You can actually see what\u2019s happening.\n\n- \u26a1 **Fast & cheap gameplay**  \n  Thanks to the **Base network**, games run with super low fees and almost no delays.\n\n- \ud83d\udcb8 **Instant payouts**  \n  If you win, you get paid instantly. No waiting, no middlemen.\n\n- \ud83e\ude99 **One token only**  \n  Everything runs on Base ETH. You don\u2019t need to deal with multiple tokens or in-game currencies.\n\n---\n\nThanks for checking out !\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- Syncing blockchain data with the UI and handling wallet interactions took time to get right.\n\n- I wasn't familiar with Base\u2019s OnchainKit and related SDKs initially. Understanding how they work and integrating them properly into the dApp required a lot of trial and error.\n\n- While writing smart contracts, I faced the common \"stack too deep\" error in Solidity, especially while handling games like Mines and Plinko with multiple parameters. I had to refactor the code and split logic into smaller functions.\n\n- Designing the profit system and game rewards was another challenge:\n  - **Dice**: Had to carefully balance win probabilities and multipliers to ensure fairness and sustainability.\n  - **Mines**: Implemented a dynamic reward multiplier based on how many safe tiles a user reveals.\n  - **Plinko**: Defined multipliers based on final slot positions, making sure the odds and returns were balanced.\n\n- Fine-tuning the economics of each game (like platform profit margins vs. player rewards) involved multiple iterations and on-chain testing."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nBefore the project, people struggled with getting authentic feedback on their Web3 and blockchain project ideas, especially from industry leaders like Jesse Pollak. \n\nEarly-stage builders faced several challenges:\n\n- Limited access to expert insights from prominent figures in the space\n- Difficulty receiving timely feedback during crucial development phases\n- No easy way to share and validate ideas before committing significant resources\n- Missing the opportunity to \"mint belief\" in promising concepts and create onchain artifacts of early supporter confidence\n- Lack of a dedicated feedback mechanism tailored specifically for Base Batches participants and onchain builders\n\nJesseGPT solves these problems by democratizing access to Jesse Pollak-style feedback, creating a unique channel for idea validation, and building a bridge between concept and community support through Zora minting. \n\nIt transforms what was once a rare opportunity (getting feedback from the creator of Base) into an accessible resource that's available 24/7 for builders.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding JesseGPT was an adventure into uncharted territory, with several technical and creative hurdles along the way:\n\n- Voice Authenticity: Getting the AI to truly sound like Jesse proved challenging initially. The first versions felt robotic and lacked Jesse's distinctive cadence and energy. We overcame this by fine-tuning the voice cloning parameters, reducing speech speed, and making subtle adjustments to pitch and emphasis patterns until the voice captured Jesse's unique speaking style.\n\n- Personality Calibration: Creating an AI that \"jesses\" authentically required extensive prompt engineering. Early versions either felt too generic or caricatured. We solved this by developing distinct personality models for both the optimistic and brutally honest Jesse variants, refining them through iterative testing until feedback genuinely reflected Jesse's thought patterns and communication style.\n\n- Crypto Vocabulary Recognition: Standard speech-to-text services struggled with recognizing Web3 terminology like \"wagmi,\" \"Farcaster,\" and \"onchain.\" We implemented custom word detection improvements in Deepgram's API to recognize crypto-native vocabulary, significantly enhancing the conversation experience for builders using industry jargon.\n\n- Dependency Deprecation: Mid-development, we discovered that 'ipfs-http-client' (a critical dependency) was deprecated, requiring a substantial refactor. We navigated this setback by migrating to 'kubo-rpc-client,' which required rewriting significant portions of the IPFS integration code but ultimately resulted in more stable performance.\n\n- Zora Integration Complexity: Deploying smart contracts through AppKit using the Zora SDK presented unexpected challenges due to unclear documentation. We spent several days troubleshooting wagmi configuration issues, eventually solving them by reverse-engineering examples and creating a custom implementation that properly interfaced with Zora's protocol.\n\nEach challenge ultimately strengthened the project, pushing us to create more robust solutions that enhanced JesseGPT's functionality and user experience."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Problem: **Finding truly authentic and relevant local recommendations is a persistent challenge. Existing platforms often rely on static, structured data that can be outdated, overly commercialized, or simply miss the vibrant, real-time pulse of a city. Users are often left sifting through generic reviews or sponsored content, struggling to find places that genuinely resonate with local experiences and current trends. Imagine planning a trip or even just a night out, and feeling unsure if the \"top-rated\" restaurant is truly a local gem or just has a great marketing budget. This disconnect leads to missed opportunities and less fulfilling local experiences.\n\n**Our Solution -** LocalGuru with Farcaster Integration: LocalGuru bridges this gap by offering a hybrid location discovery experience. We don't just give you the \"official story\" from structured databases; we enrich it with the authentic, real-time voice of the community through Farcaster.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Challenge 1:** Navigating Neynar API Nuances & Limitations\nObstacle: The Neynar API, while powerful for accessing Farcaster data, has its specific constraints, such as strict rate limits (e.g., 1-10 results for certain queries) and evolving endpoint behaviors. Early on, we encountered 404 errors, \"ExceededMaxLimit\" issues, and \"Route not found\" errors, which hampered our ability to reliably fetch relevant social data. Simply querying with combined search terms often yielded zero results due to the specificity.\n**Our Solution:** Multi-Strategy Robust Search & Fallbacks: We didn't just fix the endpoints; we engineered a sophisticated, multi-layered search strategy within our FarcasterClient.\n\n**Challenge 2: **Reliable Location Extraction from Unstructured Social Text\nObstacle: Farcaster posts are free-form text. Reliably identifying and extracting specific, geocodable location names from this unstructured data is a significant NLP challenge. Our initial API-based location extraction (/api/extract-location-names) occasionally faced 500 errors or couldn't extract locations from more nuanced cast texts. This meant even if we found relevant casts, they wouldn't appear on the map or in the location list.\n**Our Solution:** Graceful Degradation & Multi-Source Location Fallbacks: We implemented a robust fallback system for location data"

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nInvite Codes to get access to live app\n594PSL\n85078M\n473S87\n\nHedging in crypto remains prohibitively expensive due to high volatility of digital assets, combined with the speculative, short-term focus of most token ecosystems. This problem is especially acute for ETH holders and the $93B+ locked in ETH-backed derivatives such as LSDs, LP tokens, and staked collateral. \n\nWe have built on-chain Credit Default Swaps that lets ETH holders hedge above volatility at 0 upfront cost while borrowing Autonomint USDA+ stablecoin. Hedging fees are deducted from the loan value, not the user\u2019s pocket. Liquidity providers earn yield from option premiums and ETH upside, with downside risk capped at 20%\n\nThe idea originated during my time as Head of Growth at LAToken, where I noticed a shortage of call option or put option writers due to permissionless non-KYC environment which creates a high counterparty risk for option sellers/writers. In TradFi, there is some assurance for counterparty risk but not in permissionless crypto and the only other way is to overcollateralize it. So, we created a product that simplifies participation using stablecoins by making hedging more accessible, with very low upfront hedging costs and seamless liquidity by lowering down the downside risks to 20%. \n\nAlso, currently Deribit is the dominant player in crypto options today, primarily due to its ability to attract institutional option writers through strict KYC and compliance. However, this model excludes a large segment of on-chain users who lack access to such infrastructure. Instead of competing head-on to build seller-side liquidity, we take a different approach, we will enable anyone to access deeply discounted put options at 60\u201370% lower costs using our stablecoins and on-chain CDS mechanism. This opens up a new market. Our model also creates an arbitrage opportunity for Deribit\u2019s existing option writers, who can buy cheaper hedges from us and sell them at a premium on Deribit. This strategy will allow us to tap into existing liquidity while solving the accessibility and cost problem for on-chain users.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding this product required intense mathematical modeling and multiple architectural iterations. The main goal was to keep the system fully on-chain and decentralised, shifting only time-sensitive operations (like 15-second checks) to the backend. Balancing decentralization with low gas fees, fast execution, and smooth admin operations was a major challenge.\n\nOne of the toughest problems was designing the dCDS fund logic. Each new deposit or withdrawal affects every other user's position, requiring continuous recalculation of user-specific parameters across the pool. Doing this off-chain would\u2019ve been easier, but we aimed for full decentralization. So, we developed a global cumulative function architecture where all user balances and ownership are discounted to present value, allowing us to standardize fractional shifts in pool ownership efficiently. It was like creating a new way of handling Liquidity Pool user positions in some AMMs but instead of AMM, we have this derivative-based dCDS pool. \n\nWe also needed to handle liquidations, hedging triggers, and price shocks in real time for volatile collateral. This took some of our time to figure out a low latency backend that supports on-chain events while preserving the decentralized structure.\n\nAnother major objective was creating a dynamic, modular architecture so new stablecoins or volatile assets can be onboarded into dCDS seamlessly. This meant integrating oracle feeds, ODOS for smart routing, and auto-configuring backend/frontends to reflect changes within a few instructions. This was quite a challenging part as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve also integrated Symmio for hedging via derivatives and intent-based solvers, ODOS for optimal execution, Synthetix on Base for taking hedging positions, LayerZero for OApp cross-chain messaging, and OFT for omnichain asset transfers. Testing and synchronizing all these systems, while accounting for edge cases, variable spreads, platform fees, and potential integration failures, required numerous iterative cycles and robust fallback logic.\n\nAnother challenge was running a holistic simulation of a wide variety of parameters to test the resiliency of the stablecoin peg, dCDS users returns, stablecoin backing, dCDS Pool utilisation at any point of time for providing Hedging Protection, Effect of liquidations on volatile periods. I needed to create a beast of a model to test this and the product performed beautifully in all scenarios.\n\nAlso, there are some derivative spread stategies that is only possible through our product across the entire Defi space. It involves user buying a cheap hedge from us and selling a pricey put option on Deribit derivative exchange or others and making a profit on the spreads. This is only possible through Autonomint design. Since no intent or solver infra supports such option-based strategies yet, we had to build it ourselves. So, I have to literally convince solvers like Rasa Capital and Perpshub to help facilitate option derivative spreads based user intents and we created custom APIs that allow users to place and execute these derivative intents, effectively building new infra from the ground up to support this use case."

Disparate Rails & UX\n\n- **TradFi Silos**  \n  - Geography-bound systems  \n  - Multiple currency rails  \n  - Legacy batch processes (payroll, FX, bank cut-offs)\n\n- **DeFi Complexity**  \n  - Wallet management & gas fees  \n  - Token approvals  \n  - Lack of built-in compliance\n\n> **Solution:**  \n> Companies and individuals interact with a single **dashboard**. Under the hood, PayZoll intelligently routes funds via on-chain streams, fiat bridges, stablecoins, native payments, offramp support and soon to come banking and fiat rails.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Payroll & Recurring Disbursements\n\n- **Pain Points**  \n  - Manual payroll cycles \u2192 delays  \n  - High cross-border fees & FX risk\n\n- **PayZoll On-chain Payroll**  \n  - **Stablecoin payouts** for instant settlement  \n  - **Gas abstraction ( premium )** so recipients never handle transaction fees  \n  - Supports one-off payments **and** real-time streaming\n\n---\n\n### 3. P2P Trust & Recovery & Tradfi\n\n- **Traditional Crypto P2P**  \n  - Irreversible transfers  \n  - Off-chain dispute resolution\n\n- **PayZoll Trust-minimized Module**  \n  - **On-chain escrow & dispute flows** embedded in smart contracts  \n  - Familiar **address-book** to keep track of wallets just like contacts & **bill-splitting** among the friends.\n  - **Invoice**, **Subscriptions**, **Bill Setlement** and **Purchase** payments.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Fiat On/Off-Ramps & Compliance\n\n- **Current Friction**  \n  - Separate KYC/AML for each platform  \n  - Multiple interfaces to manage\n\n- **Unified Experience**  \n  - **Embedded fiat bridges** with institutional liquidity  \n  - **Single KYC/AML workflow**  \n  - **Zero-knowledge identity** options for privacy\n\n---\n\n### 5. Operational Overhead & Automation\n\n- **Pain Points**  \n  - Repetitive manual tasks (payroll runs, billing, taxes)\n\n- **AI-Powered Agents**  \n  - Automate recurring workflows **on-chain**  \n  - Trigger disbursements and compliance checks **without manual intervention**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Key Benefits\n\n- **Eliminate silos** across TradFi & DeFi  \n- **Reduce costs** & settlement times  \n- **Streamline UX** to feel like any consumer payment app  \n- **Scale** to businesses and individuals globally\n- **Unity** to be able to perform every financial transaction under one roof\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Challenges & Solutions\n\n---\n\n### 1. Integrating Centralized & Decentralized Rails\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  TradFi APIs (bank-grade settlement) and on-chain protocols follow different data models and compliance requirements.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Built a modular **\u201crouting\u201d layer** that abstracts each rail behind a common interface. Leveraged adapters for major banking partners and token bridges, with a **unified transaction schema** and **built-in audit trails**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Multi-Token Payroll\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  Multiple chain and tokens require different native interfaces and integrations, sometimes even new code structure.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Implemented **ERC20 wrappers** and **Native** transfer batch transactions to provide multi token support. Chain based modular configurations and option to switch back and forth between multiple chains and tokens using unified interface. ( Gasless transactions are under development )\n\n---\n\n### 3. Designing Trustless Dispute & Recovery for P2P\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  On-chain transfers are final; adding reversible logic risked centralization.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Developed a **decentralized dispute oracle mechanism**: if a recipient claims, a multi-party arbiter contract holds funds in escrow until off-chain evidence is submitted, then releases or refunds accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Designing splitting and Invoice Payments\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  On-chain bill payments are non existent and no easy way to abstract splits.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Developed a address book mechanism to keep wallets as contacts to easily split features among people. Analysed the current invoice protocols and build a secure and recoverable escrow based contract to process invoices and automatic recurring subscriptions.\n\nDecentralised oracle manages the dapp's issuing invoice to look for processed payments and service forwarding.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Compliance & Privacy (KYC/AML vs. User Data Protection)\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  Regulatory requirements demand identity checks, but full on-chain identity exposes privacy risks.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Integrated **UIDAI** and **PAN** verification API and wrappers to perform user authentication, offramp transaction's logging, audit data preservation and logs.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Maintaining Seamless UX Across Complex Workflows\n- **Obstacle:**  \n  Combining so many features risked overwhelming users.\n\n- **Solution:**  \n  Iterative front-end design with user testing sessions; introduced **progressive disclosure**  and a **unified dashboard** that surfaces next-step guidance.\n**Minimal** Ux and Ui allows anyone to intuitively navigate the web app and perform any action they need."

It's very difficult to have an understanding and keep track of these parameters to save guard one from catastrophic scenarios such as Liquidations.  \n\nOne of the areas of major concern are that all the lending protocols rely on price feeds on platforms such as Chainlink, Pyth network but the limit orders offered in the DeFi space are mostly based on Pool's internal pricing mechanism which is generally have a significant delay.\n\nI have developed a prototype which offers DeFi Actions on parameters from Price Feeds such as Chainlink, Live Data from Lending Protocols to execute operations which would safe guard users from liquidation. \n\n\n## Real World Scenario \n\n### Let's Assume: \n\nI have a borrow position at Aave by depositing collateral such as (ETH, BTC, cbETH) and borrowed some USDC to do yield farming and obtain a high yield to offet by borrowing interest rate. \n\n\n### Tragic Event: (Sudden Price Drop)\n\nThe Price of these volatile assets experiences a sudden drop. As Aave, relies on platform such as Chainlink to get the data. My Loan-To-Value ratio of the position starts dropping down and reaches the point of liquidation.\n\n### Traditionally: \nMost likely, I would have to face liquidation as lose more money than I would earned. \n\n### My Product: \n\nIf I had created a limit order based on my Loan-To-Value ration and deposited my Yield Farming (interest bearing tokens) as a deposit (Assuming Morpho Vault). The tokens would have been withdrawn from Morpho to obtain USDC and would have supplied or repaid based on the Limit Order Parameters.  \n\n### Protocols Integrated \n\n - Aave (Base and Arbitrum )\n - Aerodrome (Base)\n - Chainlink (Base and Arbitrum)\n - Morpho (Base)\n - Hyperlane (Base and Arbitrum)\n - Circle CCTPV2 Hooks (Base and Arbitrum)\n\n\n### Smart Contract Addresses \n\n#### Base \nFactory: 0xEc9A1021cC0d4619ac6405a648239bEB0bFCf76C\nVault Deployer: 0xbF7d635B1F6fed745d9414a414F1f8B372C0bd79\nVault : 0x2554823F28f819a6D75081Ec65f7Be1798447eBD\n\n### Arbitrum\nFactory: 0xdE8bb0fbcA6deE981c607C54f94bdd34A9D15362\nVault Deployer: 0xEc9A1021cC0d4619ac6405a648239bEB0bFCf76C\nVault: 0x20c3d47D0551fcF44F906Cb04aEBB90ef4AA0BCA\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- Identifying the parameters which would benefit the user for creating limit orders. \n\n- Configuration of Handler smart contract for interaction with each lending protocol such as Aave, Morpho Markets, Morpho Vaults and Euler required deep understanding of concepts and simulating various scenarios. \n\n- Since, there are multiple parameters required to be configured for creating an limit order, Visualizing the flow of steps was quite challenging."

AI understands intent and handles logic.    |\n| **No smart spending insights**       | Lucra acts like a personal CFO \u2014 categorizing spending, surfacing reminders, and showing trends from past transactions. |\n| **Friction in multisend & split**    | Users can say \"Send 10 to @bob and @alice\" or \"Split 100 three ways\" \u2014 Lucra auto-detects and executes onchain.         |\n| **Lack of chat-native transactions** | Group chats and @tags allow money to flow naturally in conversations \u2014 just like chatting, but onchain and instant.     |\n| **Poor accessibility for newcomers** | Coinbase smart wallet + gasless UX makes it easy even for crypto novices to onboard, transact, and manage finances.     |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc In short:\n\nLucra AI replaces **forms**, **wallet toggles**, and **technical steps** with one powerful interface: **conversation**.\nIt bridges the usability of ChatGPT with the power of Base's onchain rails \u2014 and delivers the first real \u201cWeb3-native finance assistant\u201d experience.\n\n\n\nmainnet transaction - 0xe83adfea27f20d9b3419033f23bd29c48c99dcd1d2143cbf193a229679f1244e\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n# \ud83d\udee0 Challenges We Ran Into\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Challenge 1: Interpreting Natural Language into Onchain Actions\n\n**Problem:**\nParsing flexible, ambiguous chat commands like \u201csplit 10 bucks between Bob and Alice\u201d or \u201csend 5 to Jack if he\u2019s online\u201d into structured transaction logic (token, recipient, amount) was non-trivial.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe trained and fine-tuned a GPT-4-turbo-based command parser with a JSON schema constraint and fallback heuristics. We also implemented a keyword-suggestion chip bar (like ChatGPT's follow-up suggestions) to guide ambiguous inputs toward deterministic actions.\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f Challenge 2: Multi-Recipient, Gasless, Cross-Call Execution\n\n**Problem:**\nExecuting multiple token transfers in a single sponsored transaction while resolving `@handles` to wallets, calculating equal splits, and dynamically generating calldata posed contract and bundler-level challenges.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe deployed a multicall-capable smart contract that takes an array of `recipient-amount` pairs. Basename handles are resolved off-chain with caching via AgentKit, and Coinbase Paymaster is used for gasless execution via Smart Wallet.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Challenge 3: Real-Time Transaction History & Summarization\n\n**Problem:**\nRetrieving historical onchain transactions and categorizing them by purpose (e.g., donation, refund, payroll) in real time without flooding the frontend was tricky.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe indexed each user\u2019s wallet using an internal Graph node and enriched each transaction with GPT-powered summaries, emoji-tagged categories, and recipient basenames. This data was cached and surfaced via a performant REST API.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Challenge 4: Intelligent Prompt Suggestions & UI Sync\n\n**Problem:**\nMaintaining context-aware suggestions (like \u201cWant to split the bill with @group?\u201d) across multiple chat contexts caused stale UI state and memory bloat.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe integrated Zustand for global state management and coupled our suggestion engine with the GPT parser so that every intent path included next-step suggestions as part of the output schema.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd12 Challenge 5: Security & Transaction Previewing\n\n**Problem:**\nUsers were concerned about blindly signing smart wallet transactions parsed from chat.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe built a preview engine that converts parsed intent into a human-readable preview (\u201cYou\u2019re sending 5 USDC to @alice.base, gas is 0.00 ETH\u201d), which must be confirmed before signing.\n\n---\n\nLucra AI tackles both the technical complexity **and the human friction** of making onchain interactions feel intelligent, natural, and powerful.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a downloadable one-pager or Notion-ready project doc for this!"

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nOur projects solves the problem with traditional and normal betting based very much on luck, instead we made it for the people who love to play mobile or pc games. Before this people had a fear of losing their data to the companies which organize these bets in open like Dream11 on sports, Rummy Circle etc. but here we used zkProofs to compare the results and verify it without leaking the data on chain.\nThis helps people to get a sense of security in case they lose too. Overall it elevates the betting game.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOK!! So we had a hell lot of problems while making it working:\n1. We firstly encounter the problem of generating the proof and then connecting it to the frontend, we didn't think it to be that hard, but after rigorous tries and fails, we finally did something which got it working for a reason, and there's a saying that don't disturb if it works.\n2. Second problem came when we tried to attach API calls with the zk, it seemed very easy but was not, unfortunately we were unable to gather apis from the big game companies like Valorant. so we decided to stick on COC, whose was available for free.\n3. We could not deploy it on vercel or any other website, maybe due to its complex nature, or one pain in tooth thing , that the API for COC was IP Address specific, so it was not possible  for us to  deploy it on vercel because we didn't have their IP Address and then API fetches were not made properly. So that  was it, we tried it on some static address providers but they didn't fit for our project type , all of them wanted some mobile app kinda things, so we are still stuck the demo video is shot on localhost sadly, we will try our best in future to fix it."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**DAO governance is fundamentally broken**. It's defined by *operational paralysis* and *token plutocracy*, forcing the best founders into a false choice: stay centralized to move fast, or decentralize and become irrelevant. This isn't a theoretical problem. When major DAOs like ApeCoin, with a multi-billion dollar treasury, vote to kill their own decentralization, it reveals a deep architectural failure in the current ecosystem.\n\nFirst-generation tools like Snapshot and Tally solved vote aggregation, but they don't address the root cause. They are the infrastructure for \"governance theater,\" not high-velocity operations.\n\ngovAIrn is a two-sided intelligence platform that re-architects how DAOs operate. We provide the infrastructure for the next generation of DAO tooling, focused on turning raw data into operational velocity.\n\nOur platform is built on a core innovation: the Influence Score. It's our AI engine that moves beyond simple token-voting to analyze and quantify all forms of value creation\u2014from on-chain activity and GitHub commits to social mindshare on platforms like X and Farcaster.\n\nThis engine powers our two-sided B2B2C platform:\n\n- **For DAOs (The Command Center)**: We provide an operational toolkit for leaders to get real-time visibility into governance health, use predictive analytics to forecast proposal outcomes, safely delegate tasks using a tiered system, and design merit-based reward programs. This solves the problem of governance paralysis, giving leaders the confidence to decentralize securely.\n- **For Contributors (The AI Co-Pilot)**: We provide tools for members to cut through the noise, understand complex proposals with AI-powered summaries, and build a verifiable on-chain reputation for their work. This solves token plutocracy by giving a voice and tangible rewards to real builders, not just the biggest wallets.\n\nBy creating a **symbiotic loop** between DAO operators and their contributors, govAIrn builds a defensible data flywheel. More efficient DAOs attract better contributors, whose engagement generates a rich governance dataset, making our AI smarter and accelerating our lead. We aren't just building another tool; we are building the essential **operational and reputation layer for the on-chain economy**.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**Unified DAO Ecosystem Integration**\nOne of my biggest challenges was creating a standardized interface across diverse DAOs (Uniswap, ENS, Aave, Gitcoin, StakeDAO). Each uses different data structures and governance mechanisms. I built a proposal processing service that normalizes varying timestamp formats and metadata schemas with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent functionality.\n\n**AgentKit & Delegation Implementation**\nIntegrating AgentKit required solving several complex problems: creating secure agent identities, managing delegation of voting power, and establishing secure communication between AI decisions and on-chain execution. The delegation system needed to handle partial delegation percentages while maintaining user sovereignty. I designed a multi-layered architecture with strict separation between user and agent wallets, custom wallet generation, and secure transaction queue management.\n\n**Database & Security Architecture**\nThe Supabase implementation presented challenges with row-level security policies, particularly when seeding data and performing background syncs. I implemented edge functions for critical operations that needed to bypass RLS, designed permission hierarchies based on user roles, and created a custom database structure that supported complex querying patterns for proposal aggregation.\n\n**Proposal Synchronization & Processing**\nMaintaining real-time proposal data across multiple DAOs required addressing rate limiting, efficient handling of active and closed proposals, and proper timestamp normalization. I limited syncing to the 10 most recent proposals per DAO, implemented caching mechanisms, and created a custom sorting system to ensure proposals displayed correctly by end date, which was critical for user experience.\n\n**Transparent AI Decision Framework**\nBuilding a transparent AI governance system required exposing decision-making processes without overwhelming users. I developed a specialized prompt engineering system that creates deterministic reasoning frameworks, extracts key points from proposals, and aligns outputs with user preferences. The architecture records every step of the AI's chain-of-thought reasoning and creates verifiable links between preferences, decisions, and on-chain actions.\n\n**Performance & User Experience**\nThe UI needed to handle real-time updates from multiple data sources while maintaining responsiveness. I implemented optimized rendering patterns, strategic data prefetching, and targeted component updates to create a smooth experience even when processing complex proposal data or generating AI decisions.\nThese solutions resulted in a governance platform that successfully bridges the gap between complex on-chain operations and an accessible interface for DAO participation on Base.\n\n-- \n\nUPDATED\n\nBuilding a two-sided intelligence platform that re-architects DAO governance from the ground up presented a unique set of technical and strategic challenges.\n\nMulti-Source Data Ingestion & Normalization:\nThe core of our Influence Score required ingesting and unifying wildly different datasets: on-chain voting records, unstructured GitHub commit data, and real-time social media signals from APIs like Farcaster and X. Creating a standardized data pipeline that could normalize this information, handle varying schemas, and process it into a single, coherent input for our AI engine was a major architectural hurdle.\n\nDesigning a Sybil-Resistant Influence Algorithm:\nThe credibility of our platform rests on the integrity of the Influence Score. A key challenge was designing the initial algorithmic weighting and AI models to be resilient against manipulation. I had to develop systems to detect and penalize low-quality contributions, such as spammy GitHub commits or inauthentic social engagement from bot farms, ensuring that the score reflects genuine, verifiable merit.\n\nArchitecting a Real-Time Two-Sided UI:\nBuilding a UI that effectively serves two distinct user personas\u2014strategic DAO operators and individual contributors\u2014from the same backend was a significant UX and engineering challenge. The DAO Command Center needed to present high-level analytics and complex configuration tools, while the Contributor Co-Pilot required a more personalized, task-oriented interface. Engineering a performant system that could serve both UIs with real-time data without lag was critical.\n\nBootstrapping the Predictive Analytics Engine:\nOur goal of providing predictive insights on proposal outcomes required a robust machine learning model. The initial challenge was training this model with a limited and often noisy set of historical governance data. I had to implement sophisticated feature engineering to extract meaningful signals from past proposals and build a system that could learn and improve as our platform ingested more data from new DAOs.\n\nSecure & Scalable Backend for Cross-DAO Operations:\nThe platform needed a backend that was not only scal"

People want to express belief, not just predict outcomes. They\u2019re not analysts and they want a scoreboard.\n2. Fun > accuracy. Like fantasy sports or meme coins, people play to win social capital, not just money.\n3. Markets don\u2019t have to be rational. They just have to be real-time. FlashDuels embraces narrative volatility, and creating natural market discovery for the most favourable outcome.\n4. The next breakout in consumer crypto won\u2019t look like finance.

FlashDuels draws from prediction markets, fantasy, meme trading, and InfoFi, yet belongs to none. Differentiating required building not just features, but a new narrative category. Inspired by Paradigm\u2019s Multiverse thesis, we adopted a laddered rollout to guide users into this new behavior - starting with duels, expanding to leagues, then seasonal token economies.\n\n2.

Liquidity Without Order Books: Designed a Peer-to-peer model that scales volume without fragmenting liquidity.\n\n4. Preventing Sybil Abuse: Added a bonding curve, min bets, creation fees, and creator stakes to keep bots out and skin-in-the-game real.\n\n5. UX for GenZ (particularly non-crypto users): Rebuilt the interface from scratch to feel like a tinder app on mobile - quick swipe left or right."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**Base PingPong Arena** addresses a significant gap in the blockchain gaming ecosystem: the lack of engaging, onchain-first **multiplayer** games that are both fun and accessible while also showcasing the power of decentralized infrastructure.\n\nMost blockchain games today suffer from high entry barriers, clunky interfaces, or overly financialized mechanics that limit real player enjoyment. Our project flips this narrative by offering a fast-paced, competitive **1v1** ping pong game where every match, move, and reward is **fully onchain**\u2014making gameplay provably fair, transparent, and immutable.\n\nThis project provides:\n\t\u2022\tTrustless Game Mechanics: Using smart contracts, players **stake ETH**, compete in skill-based matches, and automatically receive rewards\u2014all without intermediaries.\n\t\u2022\tNFT-Based Progression: Players mint and upgrade unique NFT paddles based on their win history, creating lasting digital assets with real gameplay utility.\n\t\u2022\tBuilt-In Marketplace: Our onchain **NFT marketplace** allows players to buy, sell, and trade upgraded assets directly on Base.\n\t\u2022\tOnchain Leaderboards: Transparent ranking and match logs increase replayability, encouraging competition and community growth.\n\t\u2022\tTrue Ownership & Interoperability: All player assets and stats are owned by users and **verifiable** on the **Base chain**, enabling future integration with other ecosystems.\n\nBy combining addictive gameplay with robust onchain infrastructure, Base PingPong Arena redefines what blockchain gaming can be\u2014simple, skill-based, and radically transparent.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nBuilding **Base PingPong Arena** was a rewarding challenge! One of the first obstacles I faced was getting the smart contracts fully deployed and functional on the Base mainnet. Since I didn\u2019t initially have Base ETH, I couldn\u2019t test or deploy anything\u2014until the amazing Base Batch team on Discord stepped in to help me out with ETH and guidance. That support kept the momentum going.\n\nFrom there, it was all about pushing the limits of onchain gameplay. I built an entire matchmaking system, **ETH staking logic**, and auto-battle resolution into the smart contract. Making all of that run fairly and securely onchain wasn\u2019t easy, but it was exciting.\n\nThen came the NFTs\u2014each player mints and upgrades unique PingPong characters based on wins. Storing that kind of dynamic data onchain while keeping it gas-efficient was a tough nut to crack, but I handled it by encoding metadata directly inside the contract.\n\nFinally, **integrating** an NFT marketplace and making sure the frontend synced smoothly with all onchain events was the last major hurdle. I used ethers.js to connect everything in real time and give users a clean, interactive experience.\n\nEvery challenge helped make the project more solid and fun to play\u2014and now it\u2019s fully live and playable on Base!"

This ensures immediate action, even when users can\u2019t access their phones or are in a panic.\n\n2. - **Automatic Location & Video Sharing:** SurakshaLink doesn\u2019t just send location data \u2014 it automatically captures live video and shares both location and video with trusted contacts. This provides a more comprehensive view of the emergency situation, allowing for faster, more informed responses.\n\n3. - **No App Interaction Needed:** Many emergency apps require users to open the app or manually press buttons. SurakshaLink works directly from the lock screen, requiring only a secret word or button click \u2014 making it faster and more intuitive during stressful situations.\n\n4. - **Customizable Trusted Contacts:** Unlike standard SOS systems that are often limited to contacting emergency services, SurakshaLink lets users set multiple trusted contacts, including friends, family, or local authorities, ensuring personalized and quicker help.\n\n5. - **Superior Reliability:** Current SOS features often fail due to network issues or system limitations. SurakshaLink guarantees faster and more reliable responses by integrating multiple communication channels and offering a secure, encrypted system for data sharing.\n\n6. - **Local Police Integration:** In India, SOS features often fail to notify local authorities effectively. SurakshaLink bridges this gap by ensuring real-time location data is shared with local police when necessary, making it easier for authorities to reach the scene quickly.\n\n7. - **Cyberpunk UI Design:** SurakshaLink stands out with its sleek, modern, and responsive Cyberpunk UI, offering users a visually appealing, intuitive interface that enhances the experience while maintaining a focus on functionality.\n\n8. - **CHATBOT:** Suraksha BOT\n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/8ad6bb18ece54abe8b79f81389f4b8de/b48ce68c-3fbe-4d6a-8376-80addefbc4ce.png)\n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/8ad6bb18ece54abe8b79f81389f4b8de/a2dcdbe8-8fdb-4d5b-8a41-ec1d4ac45aa6.png)\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Challenges I Ran Into\n\n- **\ud83d\udd04 Transition from Web to Mobile**\n\nIssue: Capacitor-based app faced performance issues.\n\nSolution: Shifted to Flutter for better native control and cross-platform support.\n\n- **\ud83c\udfa4 Voice Activation**\n\nIssue: Unreliable voice detection in background mode.\n\nSolution: Used Flutter plugins with permission handling and background service tweaks.\n\n- **\ud83d\udccd Live Location & \ud83d\udcf9 Video Streaming**\n\nIssue: Battery drain and UI lag during real-time updates.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsed Firebase Realtime Database for location.\n\nOptimized video compression for Cloud Storage.\n\n- **\ud83d\udd12 Lock Screen Emergency Access**\n\nIssue: Emergency features not working when phone is locked.\n\nSolution: Used Android foreground services and requested advanced permissions.\n\n- **\ud83d\udcda Learning Curve as a Student**\n\nIssue: Limited knowledge of app architecture and backend systems.\n\nSolution: Self-learned through documentation, trial & error, and time management.\n\nIssue: Handling sensitive user data securely.\n\nSolution:\n\nFirebase Authentication,\n\nBasic end-to-end encryption,\n\nConsidered India\u2019s Digital Personal Data Protection Act.\n\n\n\n- \n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/8ad6bb18ece54abe8b79f81389f4b8de/9a9206d5-c319-45b7-902e-8be090fc6b97.png)\n\n![image](https://assets.devfolio.co/content/8ad6bb18ece54abe8b79f81389f4b8de/455ff77d-4bd1-40cd-b118-ca3043b83940.png)"

Since access to actual GPS-based cryptographic proof or zero-knowledge location attestation was out of scope for the hackathon, we had to create a believable mock Proof-of-Visit system that still reflected the spirit of the protocol. Designing this system required balancing user experience with data integrity \u2014 ensuring that even with mock data, the demo captured how verifiable reviews could look in a real deployment.\n\nAnother obstacle was integrating dynamic browser interactions with Google Maps' DOM structure. Since we envisioned this as both a standalone mini-app and a future browser extension, identifying stable UI hooks within the Google Maps interface for future real-time detection was complex. We overcame this by modularizing our code and abstracting the verification flow to a component that could work both as a web-based mini-app and a browser extension integration.\n\nLastly, ensuring review data integrity even in a mock environment (without backend or smart contract support) pushed us to build a lightweight frontend-first data schema that could be extended later to include decentralized storage or on-chain attestation."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nTraditional immigration and visa management systems often rely on centralized authorities, paper-based documentation, and manual verification, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and lack of transparency. Our project, \"zkVisa\" leverages smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to introduce a secure, decentralized mechanism for managing visa. By allowing immigrants to stake funds linked to a visa period and securely withdraw them only upon meeting verifiable time and location conditions, the system ensures compliance while preserving privacy. This not only reduces administrative overhead but also builds trust by making enforcement automated, auditable, and tamper-resistant.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the key challenges we faced was implementing zero-knowledge proofs for location data without compromising user privacy. To tackle this, we wrote custom circuits in Circom that validate a user's presence at a specific location without revealing the exact coordinates. Integrating these zk proofs with our smart contract required careful coordination to ensure accuracy."

Unlike traditional creation tools that require coding or design skills, our system instantly builds, deploys, and even tokenizes user creations. This radically simplifies the process, making creative tech accessible to a broader audience and accelerating idea-to-launch time dramatically compared to existing platforms.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne major obstacle we faced was ensuring the AI-generated outputs were not just functional, but polished and playable without manual intervention. Early versions often produced buggy or incomplete results, which could discourage users. To overcome this, we built a \"prompt enhancement\" system that automatically upgrades simple user inputs into rich, detailed prompts optimized for better game generation. We also created a set of pre-tested templates to ensure new users always get a solid first experience. This combination dramatically improved output quality while keeping the user experience smooth and fast."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n[https://main.d318mfpii45gl0.amplifyapp.com/]\n**The Problem Medilocker Solves**\n\nMedilocker addresses several critical, interconnected problems prevalent in current healthcare data management:\n\n1.  **Fragmented and Siloed Medical Data:**\n    *   Patient medical records are often scattered across various healthcare providers, specialists, and facilities (e.g., GP, hospital, specialist clinic, pharmacy). Each system holds only a piece of the puzzle.\n    *   This makes it incredibly difficult for patients to access their complete medical history and for providers to get a holistic view of a patient's health.\n\n2.  **Lack of Patient Data Ownership and Control:**\n    *   Patients often have little to no direct control over who accesses their medical records, for how long, or for what purpose.\n    *   Accessing their own records can be a cumbersome, bureaucratic process.\n\n3.  **Inefficient and Slow Data Sharing for Providers:**\n    *   Transferring records between providers is often manual, slow, and prone to errors (e.g., faxing, mailing, incompatible digital systems).\n    *   This can lead to delays in treatment, redundant tests, and decisions made with incomplete information, potentially impacting patient outcomes.\n\n4.  **Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   Centralized databases are prime targets for data breaches, putting highly sensitive patient information at risk.\n    *   Ensuring data integrity (that records haven't been tampered with) can be challenging in traditional systems.\n\n5.  **High Administrative Overhead and Costs:**\n    *   Managing, retrieving, and sharing records manually or through disparate systems incurs significant administrative costs and staff time for healthcare providers.\n    *   Interoperability between different Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is often poor and expensive to implement.\n\n**How Medilocker Addresses These Needs or Improves Existing Solutions**\n\nMedilocker leverages blockchain technology (specifically Base L2) to offer significant improvements:\n\n1.  **Unifying Fragmented Data & Empowering Patients:**\n    *   **Addresses:** Fragmented data, lack of patient ownership.\n    *   **How:** Medilocker creates a **\"unified, patient-centered repository.\"** The blockchain acts as a secure, single source of truth that **\"follows individuals throughout their healthcare journey.\"**\n    *   **Improvement:** Instead of data being locked in provider silos, it's linked to the patient. Patients gain **\"true data ownership\"** and **\"cryptographic control,\"** allowing them to manage **\"granular permissions,\" \"temporary access,\"** and **\"revocable permissions.\"** This is a fundamental shift from provider-centric to patient-centric data control.\n\n2.  **Streamlining Provider Access & Reducing Overhead:**\n    *   **Addresses:** Inefficient data sharing, administrative burden.\n    *   **How:** Providers can get **\"instant, permissioned access to verified patient histories.\"** The platform aims for **\"universal provider connectivity\"** and **\"standardized data exchange,\"** simplifying record requests and enabling **\"real-time updates.\"**\n    *   **Improvement:** This dramatically reduces the time and effort needed to obtain patient records, leading to **\"more informed care decisions\"** and **\"reduced administrative overhead.\"** The **\"near-zero transaction costs\"** on Base L2 make frequent, small data accesses economically viable.\n\n3.  **Delivering Uncompromising Security & Privacy:**\n    *   **Addresses:** Security and privacy vulnerabilities.\n    *   **How:**\n        *   **\"Base L2 Blockchain Security\"** provides Ethereum-level, military-grade encryption.\n        *   **\"Immutable Audit Trails\"** mean every access or modification attempt is permanently recorded, ensuring data integrity and transparency.\n        *   **\"Zero-Knowledge Verification\"** allows data to be verified without exposing the sensitive underlying information.\n    *   **Improvement:** This offers a higher degree of security and transparency than many traditional centralized systems. Patients control access, and all actions are auditable, building trust and helping meet standards like **\"HIPAA, GDPR.\"**\n\n4.  **Offering a Cost-Effective, Scalable, and Interoperable Solution:**\n    *   **Addresses:** High costs, scalability issues, poor interoperability.\n    *   **How:**\n        *   **\"Near-Zero Transaction Costs\"** (up to 97% lower gas fees) make it affordable.\n        *   **\"Lightning-Fast Performance\"** and **\"high throughput capacity\"** ensure the system can handle millions of records efficiently and provide real-time access.\n        *   **\"Ethereum Ecosystem Compatibility\"** and **\"Easy API integration with existing EHR systems\"** promote interoperability.\n    *   **Improvement:** Traditional EHR integrations can be costly and complex. Medilocker's L2 approach provides a modern, efficient, and more economically sustainable model for secure data exchange, especially for features like micro-access permissions.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Challenges I Ran Into\n**1. Cross-Platform Data Compatibility**\nChallenge: Medical data is often stored in disparate formats across different hospital systems, making normalization a major hurdle.\nSolution: We implemented a standardized data exchange layer using HL7/FHIR adapters, which normalize incoming data and make it interoperable within the Medilocker ecosystem.\n\n**2. Onboarding Non-Technical Users**\nChallenge: Many users are not familiar with blockchain wallets or concepts like signing transactions and granting access via tokens.\nSolution: We integrated Coinbase OnchainKit for simplified wallet interaction and designed a user onboarding flow with tooltips, QR-based login, and a \u201cmock wallet\u201d for training/demo purposes.\n\n**3. Secure, Granular Access Control**\nChallenge: Implementing fine-grained, revocable access control for sensitive records without bloating the gas cost.\nSolution: Leveraged Base L2 for gas-efficient micro-permissions and implemented time-limited access tokens using a combination of smart contracts and off-chain access managers with cryptographic proof.\n\n**4. Decentralized Storage with Performance**\nChallenge: IPFS is great for decentralization but not optimized for speed when fetching large or time-sensitive data.\nSolution: We integrated IPFS with fallback local caching and pinning strategies to optimize for speed while maintaining decentralization.\n\n**5. Testing Across Multiple Packages**\nChallenge: Coordinating tests across a monorepo setup with contracts, frontend, and backend required extensive configuration.\nSolution: We modularized our test suites, used shared mocks, and adopted a CI setup to streamline testing across packages.\n\n**6. Sensitive Data Handling**\nChallenge: Verifying or sharing medical records without exposing sensitive information.\nSolution: Incorporated zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) frameworks to verify data attributes without revealing the data itself.\n\n**7. Smart Contract Deployment & Rollback**\nChallenge: Managing contract deployments on Base L2 with proper versioning and rollback capabilities during development.\nSolution: Used Hardhat Deploy with a detailed deployment script and contract state backup system for seamless redeployment and rollbacks."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nWhile online social platforms connect people globally, discovering and participating in spontaneous, local, in-person interactions can be cumbersome. Existing solutions often require planning and navigating separate apps.\n\n\"Base Buzz\" is a lightweight mini-app designed for seamless integration within social feeds on Base, enabling users to effortlessly create and discover spontaneous local meetups. By leveraging the social graph and location services, it facilitates real-time, in-person connections based on shared interests or immediate availability.\n\nUsers can quickly create a \"Buzz\" specifying an activity, location radius, timeframe, and optional vibe tags directly within their feed. Nearby users can discover these Buzzes and join with a single tap, opening a temporary chat for coordination. The ephemeral nature of Buzzes encourages immediate action and real-world interaction.\n\nLeveraging MiniKit & Social Graph: MiniKit allows for direct distribution within the social feed, ensuring high visibility and low friction for adoption. By tapping into the existing social graph on Base, users can discover Buzzes from their network and connect with like-minded individuals in their vicinity.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nDeveloping Base Buzz presented several interesting challenges. Integrating location services with the Base blockchain and MiniKit proved complex. We addressed the location data challenge by using a combination of the device's GPS for accuracy and network location services as a fallback, and implemented a distance filtering algorithm to only display relevant nearby \"Buzzes\". This approach also helped to conserve battery life.\n\nCreating a user-friendly interface within the constraints of a mini-app required careful design and optimization. We used React and Material UI to build a responsive and intuitive UI, focusing on clear calls to action and a simplified flow for creating and joining Buzzes.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of \"Buzzes\" introduced state management challenges. We solved this by using a combination of local state for immediate UI updates and smart contract events to ensure that all users had a consistent view of active Buzzes.\n\nFinally, ensuring scalability and responsiveness of the application within the Base ecosystem, while minimizing transaction costs, was a key consideration throughout the development process. We optimized our smart contracts to reduce gas usage and implemented efficient data fetching strategies on the frontend."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nMany entertainment applications onchain primarily focus on tokenized assets or payments, often feeling disconnected from the core user experience. There's an opportunity to deeply integrate a user's onchain identity to create truly unique and personalized entertainment experiences.\n\nBase Persona is an entertainment application that leverages a user's onchain identity on Base to unlock exclusive features, content, and personalized experiences. By recognizing the ownership of specific onchain assets, the app creates a deeper connection between the user's onchain activity and their entertainment within the platform.\nProduct: Users connect their Base wallet to \"Base Persona.\" Based on their onchain holdings (e.g., Basenames, specific NFTs, token balances), they gain access to unique aspects of the entertainment experience, such as exclusive storylines, character customizations, in-game rewards, or influence over the application's evolution. The specific entertainment format can vary, allowing for diverse applications of this core concept.\nLeveraging Onchain Identity: By utilizing Basenames and Smart Wallets for easier onboarding and recognizing the ownership of various onchain assets, \"Base Persona\" creates a novel link between a user's onchain presence and their entertainment experience, fostering a sense of digital ownership and personalized engagement.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe development of Base Persona, a project aimed at visualizing and evolving onchain identity on the Base blockchain, was not without its trials. We set out to create a user experience where a user's activity on Base directly shaped their digital representation, a concept both novel and ambitious.\n\nInitially, integrating the dynamic nature of onchain data with a compelling visual evolution system proved to be a significant hurdle. The challenge was not merely displaying static data, but rather translating a constant flow of transactions and interactions into a meaningful and engaging progression for the user's Persona. Traditional approaches fell short, and we found ourselves exploring uncharted territory in real-time data visualization within a blockchain context.\n\nThen came the issue of scalability. We were building for Base, with the expectation of a growing user base. The naive approach of querying the blockchain for every single user interaction would quickly become unsustainable and costly. We needed a more efficient way to track and process user activity without overwhelming the system.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected challenge, the one no one saw coming, was the sheer complexity of defining \"onchain identity\" in a way that felt both intuitive and rewarding to the user. What specific actions should trigger an evolution? How many stages should there be? What visual metaphors would best represent this transformation? These were not merely technical questions, but fundamental design choices that would shape the entire user experience.\n\nOur solutions, born from necessity and a bit of creative desperation, involved a multi-layered approach. We implemented a sophisticated event-tracking system that listens for specific onchain actions relevant to Persona evolution, and we designed a state management system to efficiently store and update user progress. To address the challenge of defining onchain identity, we adopted a user-centric design process, iterating through multiple prototypes and feedback sessions to arrive at a system that felt both meaningful and fun.\n\nIn the end, what began as a technical challenge evolved into a journey of discovery, forcing us to push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of onchain identity and user experience."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nOur project, Aiax, is designed to demystify and simplify the world of Web3 finance. In an ecosystem where decentralized financial tools can often feel complex, intimidating, or inaccessible to the average user, Aiax bridges the gap by providing a user-friendly platform that guides individuals through managing, analyzing, and making decisions about their crypto assets. Whether it's tracking DeFi investments, understanding on-chain activity, or comparing financial options across decentralized protocols, Aiax empowers users to take control of their Web3 finances with confidence and clarity.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSmart Contract Development:\nWriting the smart contract was a challenge due to the complexity of ensuring secure, gas-efficient logic while also keeping it flexible enough to support multiple financial interactions. Debugging edge cases, avoiding reentrancy bugs, and adhering to best practices in Solidity required a lot of careful planning and testing.\n\nIntegration with Frontend and Web3 Providers:\nIntegrating the smart contract with the frontend using libraries like Ethers.js or Web3.js presented issues with wallet connectivity, handling asynchronous blockchain calls, and managing contract events in real-time. Ensuring a smooth UX while interacting with blockchain data added additional complexity.\n\nAdding AgentKit Integration:\nIncorporating AgentKit to support autonomous agents added a significant layer of complexity. I had to learn how to set up and manage agents, make them interact securely with smart contracts, and ensure they operate reliably across different blockchain conditions.\n\nIncorporating AI for Enhanced Accessibility:\nIntegrating AI to make Web3 finance more user-friendly was both exciting and difficult. The challenge was to process on-chain data into meaningful insights and present it through AI-driven recommendations or chat interfaces. Training or prompting models to respond accurately to financial queries required testing and iteration to balance helpfulness with safety."

Opacity & Fragmentation\n- **Lack of transparency** in credit issuance and retirement erodes trust.\n- **Siloed markets** with varied standards cause confusion.\n\n### 2. High Intermediary Costs\n- Brokers\u2019 **high fees** (20\u201330%) cut funds for climate projects.\n- These costs limit buyer access, reducing efficiency.\n\n### 3. Accessibility Barriers\n- **Complex verification** and **costs** exclude small projects, especially in India.\n- Individual buyers face technical and financial barriers.\n\n### 4. Liquidity & Settlement Issues\n- **Slow trading** and inefficient settlements hinder liquidity.\n- Off-chain agreements and **double-counting** risks undermine trust.\n\n### How Base Carbon Canopy Solves These\n**Base Carbon Canopy**, on **Base Sepolia**, enhances the VCM:\n- **Transparency**: **ERC-1155 tokens** ensure traceable trades. A **Leaflet.js map** shows Indian projects (e.g., Gujarat methane capture). **AutoML Impact Scores** (0\u2013100), from **Estimated Annual Credits**, rank projects (e.g., \u201cScore: 85\u201d), building trust.\n- **Low Costs**: **Base\u2019s layer-2** and **1% mock USDC fee** cut overhead vs. 20\u201330% broker fees, aiding projects.\n- **Access**: **React DApp** with **MetaMask** simplifies trading. Impact Scores boost small Indian projects, aligning with **SDG 10**.\n- **Liquidity**: Smart contracts enable instant settlements. Impact Scores drive **mock USDC** trades, with on-chain retirement preventing double-counting.\nIt outperforms centralized registries, offering a stablecoin-driven solution for India\u2019s climate needs.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**1. Adapting to Keras for Impact Scores**  \n**Obstacle**: Using **Keras** instead of Auto-Keras for **AutoML Impact Scores** required manual model design, complicating the prediction of project impact (e.g., scores for Indian reforestation) due to limited ML expertise.  \n**Solution**: We studied Keras documentation, implemented a simple neural network with tuned layers, and trained it on **Estimated Annual Credits** and **SDGs**, achieving reliable scores.\n\n**2. Smart Contract Debugging**  \n**Obstacle**: Initial **Solidity** contracts had NatSpec errors in 'CarbonCredit.sol', preventing compilation, and restrictive logic (e.g., self-trade checks) hindered testing.  \n**Solution**: We fixed NatSpec errors, temporarily relaxed restrictive rules for testing, and redeployed contracts using **Hardhat** on **Base Sepolia**.\n\n**3. Web3 Library Breaking Changes**  \n**Obstacle**: **Ethers.js v6** updates caused runtime errors (e.g., \u201cunsupported addressable value\u201d) in **React DApp** contract calls due to outdated v5 syntax.  \n**Solution**: Updated frontend code (e.g., trading-section.tsx) to use **Ethers.js v6** syntax, like 'contract.target', after reviewing documentation.\n\n**4. Simplifying Blockchain for Users**  \n**Obstacle**: Blockchain complexity (e.g., MetaMask, gas fees) intimidated non-technical users.  \n**Solution**: Created a **Web3Provider** context to streamline wallet management, auto-switch to **Base Sepolia**, and provide clear feedback (e.g., loading states), enhancing DApp usability.\n\n**5. Testnet vs. Mainnet Constraints**  \n**Obstacle**: As students, we faced budget and time limits, preventing **Base Mainnet** deployment with real ETH costs.  \n**Solution**: Used **Base Sepolia testnet** for cost-free prototyping, ensuring mainnet-ready code for future scaling, with **mock USDC** simulating stablecoin trades."

Current options involve manual off-ramping, delays, high fees, and poor transparency.\n\nLandlords, on the other hand, are hesitant to accept crypto due to technical complexity and regulatory concerns. As a result, Web3 professionals, freelancers, and digital nomads are stuck in a broken process every month just to pay their rent.\n\nRentPay solves this by offering a simple, direct, and compliant bridge between crypto and fiat rent payments \u2014 enabling tenants to pay in stablecoins while landlords receive INR instantly in their bank accounts. No escrow. No delay. No friction.\n\nNote: INR payouts are currently simulated due to ongoing integration of compliant crypto-to-fiat off-ramp services. Only the on-chain rent payment flow is functional at this stage.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nSimulating Fiat Payouts: Since real crypto-to-fiat off-ramping isn\u2019t implemented yet, we had to simulate the INR payouts on the backend in a way that still feels real and responsive to the user. Crafting this flow without breaking immersion was tricky.\n\nListening to Smart Contract Events: Capturing RentPaid events on-chain and syncing them with our backend required careful setup using Express.js and Web3 libraries. Handling transaction confirmation delays and errors added complexity.\n\nMaintaining Sync Across Frontend, Backend, and Blockchain: Ensuring all parts of the system remained consistent and in sync during the simulated payout was a key technical challenge."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nDBeats addresses the challenge many musicians face in the traditional music industry: **a lack of direct control over their work and an often inequitable share of the revenue**. \n\nBy enabling artists to mint their tracks as NFTs, **DBeats** empowers them with new avenues for monetization, transparent ownership, and direct engagement with their fanbase. While several platforms like DBeats are emerging to help artists tokenize their music, the reality is we need many more to truly incentivize and ease the transition for creators into the blockchain space. This increased competition and choice will be crucial in helping with greater adoption, ultimately, reshaping the music landscape for the benefit of artists.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nFetching data from blockchain was a huge issue but I solved it by using Subgraphs from Alchemy. It helped me simplify fetching the NFTs and Artists from my Factory contract. \n\nA great looking UI is a must for consumer apps. I tried to make it look as much similar to web2 application design inspired by Spotify, etc. Made the onboarding easier using Smart Accounts."

Users often mint predesigned assets with little to no creative input or ongoing engagement.\nToken Tails addresses this by allowing users to generate truly unique AI-driven NFT pets, complete with custom appearances, names, and evolving backstories.\nBy combining AI generation, on-chain interactions, and a growth-based progression system, our platform transforms NFTs from static collectibles into dynamic, interactive companions-making each asset a reflection of the owner\u2019s creativity and care.\nThis approach not only improves personalization but also adds long-term engagement and emotional value-elements largely missing in current NFT platforms.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the key challenges we encountered was implementing dynamic NFTs on Base. While not overly complex, it required us to ensure that the NFT metadata could update over time especially as pets evolved. We overcame this by referring to Base docs on dynamic NFTs .\n\nAnother challenge was the attempt to integrate Base sub-accounts into the platform. since we were already using Coinbase\u2019s OnchainKit , integrating sub-accounts alongside it proved to be technically difficult and incompatible within the project scope. Despite trying different approaches, we concluded that sub-account support wasn\u2019t feasible for this version of the project"

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\nTwitch Streamers face significant challenges with traditional tipping and donation systems. Current platforms typically charge high fees (often 5-30%), impose long payout delays, and may restrict certain creators based on arbitrary policies. \n\nBstream solves these critical problems by creating a direct bridge between creators and their audience where viewer gets a custom donation URL which redirects to donation page. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform enables:\n\n1.Zero platform fees - Creators keep 100% of their donations, with only minimal network transaction fees\n\n2.Instant payouts - Tips go directly to the creator's wallet without waiting periods or holds\n\n3.Censorship resistance - No centralized authority can block legitimate creators from receiving support\n\n4. Personalized Donation Pages: Each creator gets a custom URL (username.bstream.app) where fans can send crypto donations\n\nUse these donation links in streaming in chats or bio of channel where viewers can visit the URL easily.\n\nBASE usage:\n\n1. Base Sepolia Testnet Integration: Bstream leverages the Base Sepolia testnet as its primary blockchain infrastructure, providing a cost-effective environment for testing and initial deployment.\n\n2. Direct Wallet-to-Wallet Transactions: The platform uses Base's EVM compatibility to enable direct ETH transfers between viewers' and creators' Ethereum wallets without intermediary custody.\n\n3. Chain ID Detection and Switching: Bstream automatically detects if users are on Base Sepolia (Chain ID 84532) and implements wallet_switchEthereumChain RPC calls to assist users in switching to the correct network.\n\n4. Network Metadata Configuration: The application provides proper Base Sepolia metadata to wallet providers, including RPC URL.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n1. Cross-Browser Wallet State Synchronization: Implementing a reliable system to keep wallet addresses synchronized between the client-side storage and server endpoints across different browsers and devices.\n\n2. Transaction Error Handling: Creating a robust error handling system for blockchain transactions that gracefully manages rejected transactions, network switching failures, and insufficient funds scenarios.\n\n3. Wallet Separation Logic: Preventing users from accidentally sending tips to their own wallets by implementing validation that detects and prohibits self-transactions."

These problems can be solved\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated businesses worldwide. These businesses include restaurants, theme parks as well as shopping malls. Prolonged lockdown and safe-distancing measures drastically decreased the foot traffic and revenue of these businesses, forcing them to shut down or pivot.Individual Struggles to maintain active lifestyle impacting both physical and overall well-being\n\n200K kirana stores in India only was **forced to closed** down due to rise in quick commerce\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nThe beta release is out now and currently being tested by over 200 users, which is great for gathering feedback. However, scaling the game remains a major challenge. Compared to other location-based games, there are many moving parts to consider.

Each data type brought its own battlefield:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Social Data:\u00a018,000+ Telegram groups, 4,000+ Twitter KOLs, Reddit, Discord, and news feeds-all scanned 24/7. Most sources are private, ephemeral, or flooded with spam and bots. APIs are rate-limited, blocked, or constantly changing. Extracting real alpha from meme noise and coordinated FUD is a never-ending arms race.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Onchain Data:\u00a030+ blockchains, each with unique quirks, latency, and breaking changes. Normalizing, deduplicating, and correlating millions of transactions per second is a massive engineering lift-especially when tracking smart money flows and hidden arbitrage across fragmented pools.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market Data:\u00a0Order books, ETF inflows, market maker activity, liquidation maps, options models-sourced from both CEXs and DEXs. True tick-by-tick data is expensive, fragmented, and often siloed behind paywalls or proprietary APIs. Real-time synchronization with other data layers is a challenge few have solved.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quant Data:\u00a0Volatility surfaces, correlation matrices, impact models, backtested strategies, anomaly detection-requiring high-fidelity, clean data as input. Garbage in, garbage out. Models must constantly recalibrate as market regimes shift.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offchain Data:\u00a0Token vesting schedules, funding rounds, dev activity, governance proposals, regulatory filings-often buried in PDFs, spreadsheets, or obscure forums. Scraping, parsing, and structuring unstructured data at scale, and verifying its accuracy and timeliness, is a major lift.\nThe Challenge:\nBuilding scalable, resilient crawlers and scrapers that could access, filter, and deduplicate petabytes of noisy, unstructured data-without missing the alpha buried in the chaos.\n\nThe Reality:\nEvery day, we fought API bans, captchas, DDoS attacks, and data fragmentation. We engineered our own distributed scraping infrastructure, rotating proxies, and real-time data validation pipelines. And that was just to get the raw data-before intelligence, before alpha, before edge.\n\n2.\u00a0The Intelligence Layer: Turning Data Into Alpha\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not just processing, but understanding:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had to build deep learning, NLP, and reinforcement learning models that could \u201cthink like a trader,\u201d not just regurgitate data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Challenge: Preventing hallucinations, bias, and overfitting in a world where narratives change overnight.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solution: Custom pipelines, human-in-the-loop validation, and continuous retraining on live market data.\n\n3.\u00a0Infrastructure & DevOps: Scaling the Matrix\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Massive scale, lean resources:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Orchestrating microservices, distributed crawlers, and real-time analytics across cloud and bare metal-without the luxury of infinite budgets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Challenge: Keeping latency low, uptime high, and costs sustainable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solution: Custom autoscaling, monitoring, and rapid incident response."

This way the platform would run fully on the funds provided by the users. Thus, eliminating the need for advertisements and in turn user info tracking.\n- While the aim is not to be an all in one app for everything related to crypto to keep the user experience optimal. There are some features in pipeline which should improve user journey and engagement.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n- Synching the contract with frontend and backend\n- Setting up subgraph for live tracking\n- Auth flow"

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n**1. Project Title**\nFundora \u2013 Tokenized Invoice Financing Platform on Base\n\n**2. Executive Summary**\n*Problem:*\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often face critical cash flow issues due to delayed payments on invoices. Traditional invoice financing solutions are costly, involve manual processing, and are inaccessible to many small businesses.\n\n*Solution:*\nFundora leverages blockchain technology to tokenize invoices as NFTs and provides instant liquidity in USDC through decentralized liquidity pools. By using smart contracts on the Base network, we ensure automation, transparency, and lower fees. SMEs can upload invoices and receive funding instantly, while DeFi investors earn yield by backing real-world assets.\n\n*Why Base?:*\nBase offers low-cost and high-throughput transactions, making micro-financing scalable and efficient. Its robust stablecoin ecosystem and strong developer support make it an ideal host for Fundora.\n\n**3. Problem Statement**\n*SME Cash Flow Gap:*\nOver 60% of SMEs report operational disruptions due to delayed receivables.\n\n*Centralized Financing Limitations:*\nTraditional invoice factoring involves high fees (2\u20135%), manual verification processes, and limited access for smaller businesses.\n\n*DeFi Fragmentation:*\nLack of integration with real-world assets and limited stablecoin utility in practical, business-oriented use cases.\n\n**4. Proposed Solution**\n*Invoice Tokenization:*\nMint NFTs for each invoice containing metadata like amount, due date, and credit score.\n\n*Liquidity Pools:*\nDeFi investors can deposit USDC into Base-powered pools to provide instant liquidity to SMEs.\n\n*Smart Contract Automation:*\nAll processes\u2014funding, repayment, yield distribution\u2014are handled by on-chain smart contracts.\n\nUser Dashboards:\n\n- SME Dashboard: Upload invoices, track status, and receive funds.\n\n- Investor Dashboard: View pool metrics, invest capital, and monitor returns.\n\n**5. Technical Architecture**\n\n-  Blockchain Layer: Base (Ethereum Layer 2)\n-  Smart Contracts:\n-  Written in Solidity\n-  Handles NFT minting, pool management, and yield logic\n-  Oracles: Chainlink for:\n-  Credit score fetching\n-  Exchange rate feeds\n-  Storage: IPFS for decentralized storage of invoice documents\n-  Frontend: Built using React, and Tailwind CSS\n-  Wallet Integration: MetaMask\n-  Additional Tools: Pinata Cloud for IPFS pinning\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n**- Learning Curve:**\nNew to Base, so understanding its technical stack took time.\n\n**- Code Migration:**\nAdapting our existing contracts and frontend to work smoothly on Base required significant changes.\n\n**- Testnet Limitations:**\nDifficulty obtaining Sepolia test ETH (minimum 0.05 ETH required) delayed testing.\n\n**- Wallet Constraints:**\nCurrently limited to MetaMask for wallet interactions.\n\n**- Flow Refinement:**\nHad to repeatedly revise user flows for both SMEs and investors for optimal UX.\n\n**- Transaction Logic Issues:**\nIn Module 2, we are facing challenges in implementing secure and seamless transactions between SMEs and investors via smart contracts."

By combining prediction markets with cultural commentary, it creates a highly engaging, meme-worthy experience that naturally encourages sharing and virality. Unlike traditional betting or news platforms, this project taps directly into internet culture and current events in a way that feels novel, humorous, and socially relevant\u2014making it stand out in both utility and user appeal.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\nOne of the main challenges I faced was selecting the right model for content generation\u2014balancing cost, performance, and the level of censorship. I needed a model that was powerful enough, affordably priced, and flexible enough to generate the type of content required without excessive filtering. Another key challenge was ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. To address this, I integrated embedded wallets using Privy, which allowed users to participate without dealing with complex wallet setup."

    "descriptionFull": "## The problem it solves\n\n# AI-Powered Onchain Project Manager\n\nAn AI-powered onchain project manager that handles the software development flow\u2014from idea to delivery\u2014without traditional human coordination.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Client Onboarding\nAs a client, you start by verifying your identity and explaining your project to an AI agent. The agent understands your needs and creates a GitHub repository, setting the stage for development.\n\n### 2. Developer Bidding\nIt then opens the project for bidding, allowing developers to apply. Each developer's GitHub is analyzed by an AI agent, which scores their experience. Their proof is verified onchain and they are onboarded onto the project.\n\n### 3. Developer Assignment\nOnce selected, the developer gets added as a collaborator and receives a dedicated branch to work on.\n\n### 4. Development & Submission\nAfter completing their module, the developer submits the module for review. The AI agent tests the feature in an AI-automated browser.\n\n### 5. Review & Merge\n- If everything works as expected, it releases funds to the developer, opens a pull request, and merges the work to the main branch.\n- If not, it raises a GitHub issue and provides feedback.\n\n## Features\n\n- AI agents handle **project management**, **quality control**, and **fund distribution**.\n- All transactions and interactions are **recorded onchain** in the **Base network**.\n- The goal is to make project execution **smooth** and **efficient**, powered by **onchain AI agents** and **zk proofs**.\n\n## Challenges we ran into\n\n## Core Technology\n\nThe project\u2019s core is the **Self onchain proof system**, which uses **zero-knowledge proofs** for secure identity verification. This allows clients and developers to onboard privately without revealing sensitive data.\n\nWe also integrated **GitHub verification onchain** to assess and score developers based on their GitHub profiles, ensuring only qualified individuals are selected for the project.\n\n## Custom Plugins with Goat SDK\n\nA key component of the project was the development of two custom plugins for **Vercel** and **GitHub** within the **Goat SDK**. These plugins enabled automation of:\n\n- GitHub repository interactions\n- Deployment workflows on Vercel\n- Repository creation\n- Code pushes\n- Pull requests\n\nThese integrations bridged the AI agents with the development workflow seamlessly.\n\n## Onchain Infrastructure\n\nWe deployed the project\u2019s **smart contracts on the Base network**, ensuring that all transactions and fund releases were:\n\n- **Secure**\n- **Scalable**\n- **Eco-friendly**\n\n## Automated Testing & Fund Release\n\nFor module testing, we used the **Anchor AI browser** to automatically test code in a controlled AI environment before any fund release. This ensured that everything worked as expected prior to approving contributions.\n\n## Highlights\n\nA notable achievement was the creation of custom plugins that enabled:\n\n- Seamless service integration\n- Fully automated testing\n- Smart contract-based fund releases\n- End-to-end AI-powered project management"
